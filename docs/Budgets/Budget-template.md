# Sample Budget: General Template

Here we provide estimated costs for organizing and running a hackweek. These are approximations based on previous experience at the UW eScience Institute. Costs at other locations and in other contries could be significantly different than what is listed here.

## Salaries

Many of the early hackweeks at the UW eScience Institute were partially supported by an administrative team volunteering their time and resources. However if budgets allow we advocate for explicitly including salaries for the various hack week administrative roles. 

Note: all cost listed here are "fully encumbered", meaning that they include benefits and institutional overhead costs. 

| Role | Estimated Cost | 
|------|------|
| Administrative Assistant | | 
| Facilitator | | 
| Cloud Computing Specialist | | 
| Data Scientist | | 
| Technical Specialist | | 
| Tutorial Developers | | 
| Honoraria | |

## Travel and Lodging

In the event that some of your administrative team needs to travel to the hackweek location, you may wish to cover their travel and lodging:

| Item | Estimated Unit Cost | Notes |
|------|------|------|
|Round Trip Airfare | $3,000 | cross country flight (maximum) | 

In addition, you may wish to offer travel / lodging support to hackweek participants.
