# Budgeting & Funding A Hack Week

Like any other workshop, hack weeks cost money. This includes direct costs such as rooms and catering,
as well as indirect costs including the salaries of the organizing committee.

Below, we have an abbreviated list of costs that commonly occur during a hack week. In this folder, 
you can also find detailed budgets from individual hack weeks, which might give you a closer guidance 
on how to budget your own event.

## Common Budget Items

Here are some items that we often encounter in organizing a hack week:

* room/venue bookings
* catering for coffee, biscuits and lunches
* housing costs if housing is provided to participants
* conference dinner and receptions
* fractional salary of some or all of the organizers and administrative staff
* travel funding for some or all participants
* travel funding for tutorial leads + organizing committee
* local travel arrangements (e.g. bus between hotel + venue, to conference dinner, etc)
* incidentals (printing badges, lanyards, gifts for tutorial speakers etc)

Not all hack weeks incur all of these costs, and some of these costs might be directly 
covered by the venue (for example, some venues automatically provide administrative support) 
and never appear on your budget. In addition, many of the hack week organizers are on the 
committee as volunteers who do not draw monetary compensation. However, while some of these 
costs may be hidden, it is worthwhile keeping them in mind, for example when applying for 
specific grants to support the hack week.
