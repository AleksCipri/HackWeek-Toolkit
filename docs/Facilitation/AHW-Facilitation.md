# Facilitation at Astro Hack Week

Astro Hack Week intentionally spreads itself very wide in terms of the participants we admit, and the projects we encourage participants to work on. For example, we have both early undergraduate students all the way to faculty members and senior industry experts, and the differential in computational and data analysis skills can be quite wide (though they don't have to be: Astro Hack Week has seen undergraduates teach senior faculty about things like databases!). 
In this context, Astro Hack Week operates on the principle that every participant has valuable skills to contribute, and that their unique life experience make them a valued member of our community. 

It's also worth nothing that participants come to Astro Hack Week with very different goals: some come primarily to learn, some come to make progress on a specific (PhD) research project, some come to collaborate with specific people, and others want to learn more about how to run a hackathon. The breadth of indv

Perhaps the key challenge for us as organizers and facilitators is helping each participant find and contribute to a project that they are both interested in and that matches up with their goals for learning and participation. In addition, not all participants feel equally comfortable participating, and [impostor phenomenon]() is a common occurrence at Astro Hack Week. 
The goal of facilitation at Astro Hack Week is to provide an environment where *all* participants feel welcome, accepted and their contributions are valued. With this in mind, each year there is at least one person whose primary task is facilitation. This includes setting the tone of the meeting and framing the community building in the larger context of the goals of the workshop, leading the group through activities such as ice breakers and hack pitches, and going around the room during project time to make sure the teams are functioning well and all participants are able to participate to the level that they wish to. Usually, the person facilitating does not work on a hack themselves (though in 2019, the facilitation was shared between three organizers to allow hack time for each person).

The first day is particularly important in the context of facilitating the event. It sets the tone for the rest of the week, and many participants will meet each other for the first time ever. This can be particularly intimidating to junior participants, and so making sure that everyone has the chance to meet others is a core goal. In addition, the design and pitching of projects, as well as the team formation happens on the first afternoon. This, too, requires careful facilitation to ensure the teams are off to a welcoming, healthy and productive start.

As organizers, it is very difficult to know what's in the participants' minds, and the participants' lived experience might lead them to react to certain activities very differently than we as organizers expect. We have a number of feedback mechanisms that we have implemented to receive feedback both during the week (which may allow us to make changes immediately) and at the end of the workshop (for implementation during a future event). In addition, it is worth noting that all group activities are framed as *invitations*: we do not insist that participants take part in events that require social interaction, which would be actively hostile to our participants and also counter-productive. We rather invite participants to take part based on how well they feel able to do so. One notable exception to the rule is the Code of Conduct: we do require all participants to adhere to the Astro Hack Week Code of Conduct, and ask participants to confirm their willingness to do so upon applying to the workshop.

With the above considerations in mind, we have implemented some activities to guide participants through Astro Hack Week.
These are all based on the following ground rules that we as organizers and facilitators strive to follow and implement during the week:

* The code of conduct sets the ground rules and minimum standard for all interactions
* Remind participants repeatedly to think about 
	- their interactions, 
	- the dynamics within their interactions and groups
	- the space they occupy (relative to others)
	- the distribution of talking time/space to participate
* Also remind participants to pay particular attention to known dynamics (e.g. with respect to academic seniority, gender, race, …)
* Do not interrupt speakers (unless they won’t shut up)
* Encourage questions and give others the benefit of the doubt (don’t tell people “I can’t believe you don’t know this!” or something of the sort)
* Encourage participants to engage critically with and think about how they interact with others

## Detailed Descriptions of Activities


###  Community Building: Impromptu Networking
Description: [Impromptu Networking](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/impromptu-networking/)
When: About (as needed potentially every morning)
Duration: ~15-20 minutes
Why: Provide a non-threatening environment for first interactions between participants, reduce barriers to interactions, gives them a chance to introduce themselves to others and get to know them in a short while. The short amount of time for each interaction reduces the chance for participants to “panic” about making a good first impression. Also aims to set the tone for the week and get participants to think about their own goals and obstacles for the week. The responses have to be fast, so they’re designed to be stream-of-consciousness and somewhat unpolished.
What: Get everyone to stand up and spread through the room. Ask them to find someone they haven’t met before. They have 90 seconds to complete the sentence on the slide. After 90 seconds, ring bell and get participants to switch to a new partner, with a new sentence. Repeat ~10 times. Remind participants that 90 seconds is short, and that they’re responsible for giving the other person enough time for their answer.

Materials: Bell, slides with sentences to be completed.

Observations and Feedback: This seemed to work pretty well. Participants took part fairly enthusiastically. Not all used the prompts; some just introduced themselves and chatted about what they planned to do this week, and that’s okay. Initial feedback indicates that people enjoyed it, but that the room was too loud. Perhaps, if possible, spread out into the hallway, if available? I don’t know if there’s a better way to control the volume. Also, I think initially it’s important to get people to move away from the tables they were sitting at, so they don’t just turn to their neighbour. 
Boris suggests that 90 seconds is a bit short, and that 9 sessions might be too many? Maybe make it two minutes instead (a few people told him that). One thing we need to look out for that some of the questions might be triggering for people with social anxieties and mental health problem (e.g. “a voice I need to stop listening to is …”), so it’s worth thinking critically through the questions.

Feedback from Charley:
Do it outside when the weather is good! Can help disperse the noise
90 seconds is too short; try 2 minutes
Watch people, perhaps vary it
From convo with Daniela, do 5 or 6 of theses
From last year feedback, do this outside, maybe write the prompts on a big piece of paper and hold it up
