You might be wondering, what is a hackweek? Some brief history:
    <ul>
        <li> Hackweeks were designed 5 years ago at eScience
        <li> The idea was to blend teaching with open project time
        <li> Review our overall mission common across all hackweeks
        <li> We can realize our mission only when we create the conditions for a positive learning environment
        <li> As an organizing committee, it  is our responsibility to create and sustain this environment so that each of you can do whatever learning you need to do this week
        <li> Next we will discuss our shared principles and code of conduct that are the foundation of creating this learning community
    </ul>

    <td> Norms of Behavior: integration</td>
    <td>Invite participants to actively engage with the norms of behavior</td>

    <p>4 minutes: turn to your partner: “which of these norms most resonates for you?”
    <p>4 minutes: turn to a different partner: “Which of these norms is most challenging to you?”

    <ul>
        <li> As we transition into our first tutorial, let’s return to one of the core missions of our hackweek: peer learning
        <li> One very unique component of hackweeks is that we intentionally maximize diversity in who we accept to the program. That includes disciplinary diversity. Folks in this room come from a wide variety of fields, each with their own technological tools and vocabularies.
        <li> Therefore,everyone approaches these tutorials with their own particular combination of disciplinary and data science knowledge. Material could be overwhelmingly new, or in some cases you may have already mastered it in your own training. Most people will reside somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. 
        <li> We therefore encourage you to help each other along in your learning journey. If you already have some material mastered, this could be an opportunity for you to teach others in the room who may not have encountered this material yet.
