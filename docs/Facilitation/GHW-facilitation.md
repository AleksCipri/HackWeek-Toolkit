At geohackweek we distributed post-it notes to each team on day 3 of the event and invited everyone to write down specific things that were working well, and other things that were areas for improvement. These were then displayed anonomyously on poster paper attached to a wall visible to everyone. As a group we then looked for patterns and common themes and discussed potential courses of action to address chellenges that needed to be solved.
