# Facilitation at Astro Hack Week

## Detailed Descriptions of Activities

###  Community Building: Impromptu Networking

* **Description**: [Impromptu Networking](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/impromptu-networking/)
* **When**: Very early on, before the first coffee break (as needed potentially every morning)
* **Duration**: ~15-20 minutes
* **Why**: Provide a non-threatening environment for first interactions between participants, reduce barriers to interactions, gives them a chance to introduce themselves to others and get to know them in a short while. The short amount of time for each interaction reduces the chance for participants to “panic” about making a good first impression. Also aims to set the tone for the week and get participants to think about their own goals and obstacles for the week. The responses have to be fast, so they’re designed to be stream-of-consciousness and somewhat unpolished.
* **What**: Invite everyone to stand up and spread through the room. Ask them to find someone they haven’t met before. They have 120 seconds to introduce themselves to each other and complete the sentence displayed on the slide (see below for examples). After 120 seconds, ring bell and get participants to switch to a new partner, with a new sentence. Repeat ~7-8 times. Remind participants that 120 seconds is short, and that they’re responsible for giving the other person enough time for their answer.

* **Materials**: Bell, slides with sentences to be completed.

## Project Check-Ins

We distributed post-it notes to each team on day 3 of the event and invited everyone to write down specific things that were working well, and other things that were areas for improvement. These were then displayed anonomyously on poster paper attached to a wall visible to everyone. As a group we then looked for patterns and common themes and discussed potential courses of action to address chellenges that needed to be solved.
