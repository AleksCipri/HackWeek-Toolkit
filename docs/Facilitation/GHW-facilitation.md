You might be wondering, what is a hackweek? Some brief history:
    <ul>
        <li> Hackweeks were designed 5 years ago at eScience
        <li> The idea was to blend teaching with open project time
        <li> Review our overall mission common across all hackweeks
        <li> We can realize our mission only when we create the conditions for a positive learning environment
        <li> As an organizing committee, it  is our responsibility to create and sustain this environment so that each of you can do whatever learning you need to do this week
        <li> Next we will discuss our shared principles and code of conduct that are the foundation of creating this learning community
    </ul>
