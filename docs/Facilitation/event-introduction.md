# Event Introduction

The opening session provides organizers with a unique opportunity to set the overall tone of the event. Hackweeks are a relatively new learning model, so participants may arrive on the first day not knowing quite what to expect. Careful planning of the opening session can help alleviate participant anxiety by establishing a code of conduct and norms of behavior, and setting intentions around building a welcoming learning environment.

We detail below a variety of topics and activities that can be included in the opening session. We have experimented with opening sessions lasting as long as 1.5 hours. The length you choose will depend on the total number of activities planned.

## Welcoming Remarks

Usually the event begins with brief opening remarks, often by the lead organizer of the hackweek. Topics in the welcoming remarks may include:

* acknowledging the substantial time commitment participants are making to attend the event
* thanking organizers, tutorial leads and guest speakers
* acknowledging sources of funding
* speaking briefly about the history, formation and overall mission of the hackweek model
* talking through logistics of the room setup, timing and location of breaks and meals and the overall schedule of the event


## Code of Conduct

The code of conduct defines the rules and acceptable behaviors of participants during the event. All hackweeks post their code of conduct online ([example code of conduct](https://geohackweek.github.io/wiki/code_of_conduct.html)) and require participants to have read and agree to these terms before they register for the event. 

During the opening session we draw everyone's attention to the code of conduct again as a way to emphasize its importance. We recommend providing a handout with the code of conduct listed in writing, and talking through the various options participants have to report a code of conduct violation.
