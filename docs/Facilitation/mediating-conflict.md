# Mediating Conflict

Our events invite people into experiences where they may find themselves stretching their limits. This can be uncomfortable and result in situations where conflicts occur. It is important to be aware that such conflicts are a natural part of any educational and collaborative environment, and in fact are often a sign that people are exploring innovative new ways of working together. It is the role of the facilitators to notice such situations and offer redirection or intervention where appropriate.
