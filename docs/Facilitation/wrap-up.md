# Wrapping Up

The end of an event provides an opportunity for reflecting on successes, failures and lessons learned. We encourage these reflections by inviting participants to complete a survey, which is an important data gathering tool that can be used to inform the hosting of future events. We also ask people to share what they learned during group presentations. 

## Event Survey

## Final Presentations

Final presentations are an opportunity for everyone to share what was accomplished within each team to the entire group. The duration of the presentations are fixed, but the format is flexible to allow groups to design a presentation that fits their particular work. We find that most groups distribute the speaking opportunities to most if not every member of the team, with one person providing an overall summary and integration of the work presented.
