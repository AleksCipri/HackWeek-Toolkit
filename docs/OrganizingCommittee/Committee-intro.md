# Organizing Committee

A hack week's organizing committee includes anyone responsible for some level of decision making and/or activity on which the planning and implementation of the hack week depends. Examples include tutorial developers, teachers, logistics coordinators and overall event leaders. There are many different ways to separate out the various roles and responsibilities of each committee member. Here we outline various organizational structures we have explored, and describe the sequence of steps needed to develop and maintain a healthy organizing committee.  

## Key Principles

The overall guidelines for formulating an effective and functioning organizing committee include:

* adopting a distribute leadership model: by empowering people across the organizing committee to make decisions, the committee can be more adaptive to change and there will be fewer points of failure if an individual is unable to participate
* having clearly defined roles: being as explicit as possible about the roles and responsibilities of each member of the committee will help reduce friction and ensure that everything gets accomplished
* practicing what we preach: meetings and activities conducted by the committee are great opportunities to put into practice the codes of conduct and norms of behavior that we emphasize during the hack weeks. 
* acknolwedging early on that running these events take a lot of everyone's time and energy, and that it is essential to recognize everyone's contributions in ways that are meaningful for each individual who contributes.
