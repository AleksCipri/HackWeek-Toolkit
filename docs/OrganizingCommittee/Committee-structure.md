# Committee Structure

Planning a hack week can be extremely challenging. These events are inherently designed to explore complex social, cultural and technical aspects of the data science landscape. By design there are often many different people involved in event planning, each having different perspectives. Often event planning conversations happen within rigid, bureaucratic academic structures that might not be set up to contain the more fluid and dynamic organizational tools needed to navigate complex systems.

Some examples of past points of friction include:

* difficulty coming to agreement on what should be taught
* different opinions on how to do participant selection, for example whether to consider diversity criteria, and if so, which criteria should be included
* a lack of clarity on who is doing what due to poorly-defined roles and responsibilities
* different ideas about what constitutes a high-quality tutorial
* people not following through on tasks that they agreed to take on

Moving forward we hope to find ways to build committee structures based on these principles:

* adaptive leadership: In some cases committee members might just wish that the event leader would make  the big decisions so that we could all move on. This top-down leadership approach might work for narrowly-defined events, but this is not in keeping with the shifting landscape we are all trying to navigate. We advocate for adaptive leadership principles, in which leaders do not claim to have all the answers but rather work to help the team recognize and navigate the range of possible future states to be explored.
* building strong communication networks
* giving people latitude to experiment 
* making it safe to fail
