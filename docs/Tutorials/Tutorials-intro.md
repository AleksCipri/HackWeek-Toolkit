# Hack Week Tutorials

Tutorials provide opportunities for focused learning on a well-defined data science topic relevant to the goals of a particular hack week. Tutorials are delivered by committee organizers, guest speakers or hack week participants who have direct knowledge of the topic. Usually tutorials are prepared in advance, however in the spirit of the peer-learning model of hack weeks, many events also leave ample space for more open tutorial sessions that rely on the expertise of participants in the room. 

Whenever possible, hack weeks should strive for the highest possible level of pedagogical skill in delivery of educational content. For tutorials prepared in advance, this means taking the time to articulate learning outcomes, peer-reviewing tutorials for clarity, and practicing tutorial delivery in advance. For more spontaneous tutorials during the event, facilitators can take a role in helping people prepare content for clarity, asking questions when topics might not seem entirely clear, and ensuring presenters speak and display their work with clarity.
