# Venues for Participant-Driven Events

The details of the *space* where the workshop takes place are often overlooked when 
organizing scientific workshops, but has in practice a huge effect on the dynamics and 
the success of a workshop, especially on participant-driven events like hack weeks (for 
a discussion about how physical spaces are key to data science collaborations, see also 
the [MSDSE Report](http://msdse.org/files/Creating_Institutional_Change.pdf)).

There are two key components to discussing the venue: the *location* (i.e. the country, 
city and location within the city) that the physical venue is located in, and the *venue* 
itself, i.e. the room or rooms where most of the interactions will take place.

Below, we will discuss each in turn. Here, like with all parts of hack week organization, 
*accessibility* and *inclusion* are the key considerations that should come first.  

## Location

In organizing a hack week events are faced with opportunities and constraints related to 
the overall physical location of the venue. For example, it may be easier for an organizer 
to reserve rooms at their local university, or funding agencies might have restrictions on 
where the event can take place. 

There are, however, larger considerations that should play a role when deciding on a venue. 
For example, it may be difficult to impossible for participants from certain countries to 
obtain travel visas for the US and some European countries. Organizing a workshop in these 
countries may therefore exclude an entire group of potential participants. Similarly, flights 
to certain locations may be particularly expensive and/or cumbersome, requiring multi-day travel 
for the majority of participants. This, in turn, may exclude participants e.g. with childcare 
responsibilities, who do not want to spend an extra 3-4 days travelling, or participants for 
whom long travel is otherwise challenging. There is some trade-off: large cities often have 
more direct flights (and often also cheaper flights) available, but accommodation may be 
particularly expensive. This may present a challenge for participants from institutions or 
countries where funding for conference travel is scarce.
Fundraising a significant amount of travel funding through sponsorships and grants can alleviate 
some of the financial concerns, and in some places, university accommodation might be available 
for much less cost than a hotel room would cost.

In addition to accommodation and travel, it is worth asking how accessible the *city* where the 
hack week is located is to different foreigners. For example, a small town in France or Germany 
may be difficult to navigate for participants who do not speak those languages. Many old European 
cities have uneven cobblestone streets and buildings (especially restaurants or bars) made inaccessible 
by stairs, which may present a problem for particpants with mobility issues.
On the other hand, organizing the workshop in a location with frequent, reliable and accessible 
public transport is a an advantage, particularly for participants who can not or will not drive
a car. 
Different countries have different attitudes and laws about certain groups of people, and it is 
important to ask in advance whether the chosen venue will be *safe* for the participants. 
For example, organizing a hack week in a country with anti-LBTQ laws excludes these participants 
from the start.

To summarize, some relevant characteristics to check upon are:
* Ease of obtaining travel visas + entry to the country at the border
* Ease and expense of travel to/from location
* Is the chosen venue safe for all participants, especially those belonging to minority groups?
* Ease and expense of obtaining accommodation
* Ease of communication for participants who do not speak the local language
* Accessibility of the chosen location (for example, are the majority of buildings accessible to participants with mobility aids? Are braille signs widely available?)
* Is public transport, wide-spread, frequent, reliable and accessible?

We have so far not found a single location that agrees with all of those points. For recurring events, 
it may be a good idea to move the event around, in order to improve accessibility to different groups. 

One potential solution could also be to organize not one, but multiple events at the same time in 
different parts of the world, linked through e.g. dedicated video chatrooms, asynchronous chat organizations 
and other technological means. Especially for heavily oversubscribed workshops, this might allow a wider range 
of people to participate in these events. As of now, none of the hack weeks has tried this, though some 
(especially Astro Hack Week) are considering this model.
