# Past and Potential Venues for Hosting Hack Weeks

Hack weeks can and have been hosted at universities, for example in university library 
spaces or active classrooms. There is also a growing number of venues that facilitate 
organization of scientific conferences (and especially discussion meetings) that are 
great venues for hack weeks (and often come with the benefit of some administrative 
support).

This document compiles a list of venues where hack weeks have been hosted in the past,
or that we think might potentially be good venues. Note that many of these require 
an application >12-18 months in advance of the workshop!

If you have additional venues in mind that might make great venues for hack 
weeks (either specific to a scientific field or a specific geographic region), 
please share your suggestion with us through [the issues](https://github.com/uwescience/HackWeek-Toolkit/issues).
Because organizing events in the US and EU countries can present significant obstacles to 
participants from some countries (both in terms of travel and in terms of acquiring travel 
visas), we are particularly curious about potential venues in Africa, Asia and Australia.
