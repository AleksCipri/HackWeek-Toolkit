For example, we have both early undergraduate students all the way to faculty members and senior industry experts, and the differential in computational and data analysis skills can be quite wide (though they don't have to be: Astro Hack Week has seen undergraduates teach senior faculty about things like databases!). In this context, Astro Hack Week operates on the principle that every participant has valuable skills to contribute, and that their unique life experience make them a valued member of our community. It's also worth nothing that participants come to Astro Hack Week with very different goals: some come primarily to learn, some come to make progress on a specific (PhD) research project, some come to collaborate with specific people, and others want to learn more about how to run a hackathon. The breadth of indv Perhaps the key challenge for us as organizers and facilitators is helping each participant find and contribute to a project that they are both interested in and that matches up with their goals for learning and participation. In addition, not all participants feel equally comfortable participating, and impostor phenomenon is a common occurrence at Astro Hack Week. The goal of facilitation at Astro Hack Week is to provide an environment where all participants feel welcome, accepted and their contributions are valued. With this in mind, each year there is at least one person whose primary task is facilitation. This includes setting the tone of the meeting and framing the community building in the larger context of the goals of the workshop, leading the group through activities such as ice breakers and hack pitches, and going around the room during project time to make sure the teams are functioning well and all participants are able to participate to the level that they wish to. Usually, the person facilitating does not work on a hack themselves (though in 2019, the facilitation was shared between three organizers to allow hack time for each person). The first day is particularly important in the context of facilitating the event. It sets the tone for the rest of the week, and many participants will meet each other for the first time ever. This can be particularly intimidating to junior participants, and so making sure that everyone has the chance to meet others is a core goal. In addition, the design and pitching of projects, as well as the team formation happens on the first afternoon. This, too, requires careful facilitation to ensure the teams are off to a welcoming, healthy and productive start. As organizers, it is very difficult to know what's in the participants' minds, and the participants' lived experience might lead them to react to certain activities very differently than we as organizers expect. We have a number of feedback mechanisms that we have implemented to receive feedback both during the week (which may allow us to make changes immediately) and at the end of the workshop (for implementation during a future event). In addition, it is worth noting that all group activities are framed as invitations : we do not insist that participants take part in events that require social interaction, which would be actively hostile to our participants and also counter-productive. We rather invite participants to take part based on how well they feel able to do so. One notable exception to the rule is the Code of Conduct: we do require all participants to adhere to the Astro Hack Week Code of Conduct, and ask participants to confirm their willingness to do so upon applying to the workshop. With the above considerations in mind, we have implemented some activities to guide participants through Astro Hack Week. These are all based on the following ground rules that we as organizers and facilitators strive to follow and implement during the week: The code of conduct sets the ground rules and minimum standard for all interactions Remind participants repeatedly to think about their interactions, the dynamics within their interactions and groups the space they occupy (relative to others) the distribution of talking time/space to participate Also remind participants to pay particular attention to known dynamics (e.g. with respect to academic seniority, gender, race, \u2026) Do not interrupt speakers (unless they won\u2019t shut up) Encourage questions and give others the benefit of the doubt (don\u2019t tell people \u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t know this!\u201d or something of the sort) Encourage participants to engage critically with and think about how they interact with others Story Board Add story board here! Detailed Descriptions of Activities Community Building: Impromptu Networking Description : Impromptu Networking When : Very early on, before the first coffee break (as needed potentially every morning) Duration : ~15-20 minutes Why : Provide a non-threatening environment for first interactions between participants, reduce barriers to interactions, gives them a chance to introduce themselves to others and get to know them in a short while. The short amount of time for each interaction reduces the chance for participants to \u201cpanic\u201d about making a good first impression. Also aims to set the tone for the week and get participants to think about their own goals and obstacles for the week. The responses have to be fast, so they\u2019re designed to be stream-of-consciousness and somewhat unpolished. What : Invite everyone to stand up and spread through the room. Ask them to find someone they haven\u2019t met before. They have 120 seconds to introduce themselves to each other and complete the sentence displayed on the slide (see below for examples). After 120 seconds, ring bell and get participants to switch to a new partner, with a new sentence. Repeat ~7-8 times. Remind participants that 120 seconds is short, and that they\u2019re responsible for giving the other person enough time for their answer. Materials : Bell, slides with sentences to be completed. Sample Statements : What first inspired me in this work is \u2026 One thing I\u2019d like to learn this week is \u2026 A challenge I hope we make progress on is \u2026 I belong at Astro Hack Week because \u2026 Something I am proud of is \u2026 Something I plan to give to this community is ... My hope is that people will experience me as \u2026 Astro Hack Week will be a success for me if \u2026 For fun, I \u2026 In my free time, I like to ... When it\u2019s all said and done, all I want is \u2026 Additional statements, if the exercise is repeated in the mornings throughout the week: Yesterday, I learned that \u2026 In my interactions with others, I particularly enjoyed ... Today, I\u2019d like to try to ... Observations and Feedback : Participants took part in this at Astro Hack Week fairly enthusiastically. Not all used the prompts, some just introduced themselves and chatted about what they planned to do this week, and that's perfectly fine, too. There were two important observations and feedback that are relevant for future uses of this activity: Some of the statements might be triggering for participants with social anxiety and mental health issues (e.g. in the first version of this activity one of the prompts read \"A voice I need to stop listening to is ...\"). We've since tried to eliminate those statements, and remain attentive to feedback regarding prompts that might make our participants uncomfortable. One issue with this activity is that 50 people all talking to one another at the same time can get very loud! Ideally, do this activity outside if weather permits, or in a space that allows participants to spread out and that doesn't echo too much. Something that we haven't solved very well so far is how this exercise might work for participants with mobility issues. Because it requires standing and moving about, this might unintentionally exclude some participants. There could be a variant where this exercise involves paired chairs, and only some participants move about. The invitation would be for roughly half of the participants to stand up and find a partner, while the remainder stays seated. In either case, however, it's useful to get participants to move away from the tables they might normally be sitting at and away from their computers, if possible. Introducing and Framing Astro Hack Week When : At the beginning of the week, right after the Impromptu Networking Duration : About 30 minutes Why : Many participants come in with just a vague idea of what Astro Hack Week is and what its goals are. This introduction aims to give participants an overview of the workshop, the practical logistics (schedule, bathrooms, lunches, social events etc.), and especially the rules and expectations for working together and for building an inclusive learning environment. What : About a half-hour presentation by the organizers, covering the elements and structure of the workshop, logistics, the code of conduct and other aspects of working together for the week. At Astro Hack Week, it has been important to us not only to reinforce that the code of conduct is to be followed at all times (both during the workshop itself and social times outside of it), but actively goes into detail how we want participants to behave and interact with one another. This includes welcoming questions and providing useful answers, experimenting with Astro Hack Week itself, trying out something new, listening to each other, respecting each other's pronouns, being kind to one another, and being open to learn about one another, both in terms of technical knowledge as well as from other people's lived experiences. This discussion also includes a note on impostor phenomenon, which we've found to be prevalent at Astro Hack Week. Material : Slides (an example of our slides from Astro Hack Week 2018 is available here ) Building Positive Learning Environments Through a Data Visualization Tutorial During Astro Hack Week 2018 and 2019, the first tutorial of the week was a data visualization tutorial. Because data visualization is one of the less technically complicated topics, and because it allows for many opportunities to practice group interactions, we chose it as a vehicle to also model and practice inclusive group work with our participants. We guided our participants through a series of group activities that allowed them to self-discover important data visualization principles and put them into practice, while also providing them with structures to help them with the project work later. Community Building: 1-2-4 All for Data Visualization Description : 1-2-4-all When : at the start of the data visualization tutorial Duration : 20 minutes (silent reflection: 2 minutes, pairs: 4 minutes, groups of 4: 6 minutes, whole group: 8 minutes; see also feedback + observations below ) Why : Best practices and rules are most easily accepted when they are grounded in the students\u2019 own experiences. Especially with data visualization, more than other fields, there is likely a lot of expertise scattered through the room already, and most participants, even students, are likely to have an intuitive sense of whether a particular visualization is effective at communicating information. This exercise is aimed at co-creating best practices for effective data visualization. The secondary goal is to give participants a structure and a framework for group interactions and working in teams, which they may adopt for the free-form hacking later during the day/week, and reinforce good practices for communicating and cooperating. What : Invite participants to sit down next to someone they don\u2019t know. Each participant gets one data visualization to look at: some sample visualizations are fairly competent at communicating information, some are not. Each participant is then asked to answer three questions (see below) in silent reflection (2 minutes). In the next step, participants are grouped in pairs, and discuss their answers, co-creating a common set of best practices (4 minutes). In the third step, groups of four discuss the common set of best practices and (6 minutes) rank them by importance. In groups of four, a pen or crayon will serve as a talking object. Only the person with the object speaks, and each person mentions one rule, then passes on the object. One person has to be a note-taker (for the shared online document). Participants should invite the most junior person to speak first, but they\u2019re free to say \u201cpass\u201d and let someone else begin. Finally, each team shares a practice with the entire group, which a note-taker records in the shared online document. Once each team has had a chance to speak, if there are further best practices, we go through the groups again and allow each group to mention another best practice. Material : pens/crayons, print-outs of data visualizations, set-up of a shared online document Questions : What information does this data visualization convey What does this data visualization do well in communicating information? Can you think of ways in which you would improve this data visualization? What general rules can you derive for communicating information visually? Observations and Feedback : 20 minutes is way too short for this exercise, partly because participants require more time to take in the visualization and answer the questions, but also because they are excited to share their conclusions both in pairs and groups of four. For the second iteration of this exercise, we restricted ourselves to just two data visualizations, and gave roughly half the participants each. I think 45 minutes is a better time estimate for this exercise in total (5 minutes silent contemplation, 10 minutes in pairs, 15 minutes in groups of four, 15 minute for summary with the group). One suggestion has been to give this exercise more practical structure by providing participants a page with 4 quadrants, each signifying one of the questions. The participants are then asked to note down their observations in each quadrant, and circle one observation in each quadrant that stood out to them. Community Building: Improve a Data Visualization When : In general, the 1-2-4-all exercise above is followed by a bit of a lecture-style introduction into some concepts that give the participants a bit of practical background on some of the visualization principles they co-created (e.g. pre-attentive processing, Gestalt psychology). Following this, the participants get the opportunity to take an existing data visualization and improve upon it. Duration : 60 minutes Why : Learning new principles and ideas functions best through practice and trying it out. In this activity, participants will work in teams of 3-4 to take an existing data visualization and improve upon it visually. Again, this structure aims to give participants a framework for how to interact in teams and learn some of these principles of constructive interaction in a non-threatening setting. What : Participants will be asked to team up in groups of 3-4 and pick a data visualization. It can be a plot they have made (voluntary!), or they can pick one of the ones that the instructors bring along. During the first ten minutes, participants identify improvements to be made in the existing visualization, using the same rules as during the group-phase of the 1-2-4-all: each person gets to say one thing, then passes the talking pen off to the next person. A person who would not like to add anything can say \u201cpass\u201d and pass on the pen. Participants should invite the most junior person to speak first, but they\u2019re free to say \u201cpass\u201d and let someone else begin. One person takes notes. Once all the possible improvements have been put onto paper, participants vote on their top 5 improvements (each gets 3 votes), and start collecting ideas for how to improve in a similar manner as before. They take a piece of paper and pin it to the wall, then use the crayons to draw out a sketch of the new visualization. If there is time, they can attempt to create it on a computer, but emphasis here is on creating a prototype together on paper. During the last 15 minutes, a member of each team will share the results with the rest of the groups. Notes : Some of the design elements of this exercise were chosen particularly to enable positive group collaboration and facilitate the best learning outcome. Do not pick figures from your own field as bad examples for visualizations, unless you can be absolutely sure that the author is not in the room (for example, by choosing your own). Having a figure you might have spent weeks on publicly dissected without being warned that this might be happening is absolutely terrifying and has a chilling effect. You do not want this to happen. Thankfully, the internet is full of terrible, professionally produced visualizations for you to pick from. The exercise explicitly uses crayons on paper, because with computer-based exercises, the group can be too easily side-tracked into specific questions of how to plot one particular thing with that specific plotting library. In addition, team members might have different skill levels in computer-based visualization, which may lead to some participants programming, while others sit at the sidelines being excluded from participating. Secondly, we chose to pin paper to the wall specifically because it means that participants are all facing the same way, toward a common goal. This is markedly different from paper that's spread on a table, with people standing around. In the latter case, participants disagreeing with someone else's suggestion do so while facing them, which can feel more confrontative than while everyone is facing the same way towards the paper on the wall. Material : pens/crayons, print-outs of data visualizations, large sheets of paper, tape, empty walls Observations and Feedback : Expect ~10 minutes to pick a figure, ~30 minutes to prototype a figure, and another ~15 minutes to collect the results (depending on group size, of course; this was for ~50 participants). Participants really enjoyed both the figures and the crayons. It made this much more playful and much less intimidating than it would otherwise have been (and some participants noted that specifically in the feedback). One out of ten groups chose to use their own figure instead of one of those I provided. Putting the (empty) posters on the wall was really helpful, I think, because people started talking about the poster, rather than toward each other (which suggested might be less confrontational). We also observed that many participants who didn\u2019t want to share their group\u2019s conclusions during the first exercise participated enthusiastically in the drawing, so it seemed to have succeeded in getting people to interact. Facilitating the Hacking The project work component of Astro Hack Week requires careful facilitation in particular, because it is otherwise very free-form and can be very intimidating to new participants and those who are introverted and/or shy. In particular pitching potential projects to the entire group requires a lot of self-confidence in one's ideas and ability to convey them in less than a minute. We start this part of the workshop with a short introduction into what a hack is, and the characteristics of a good hack (see also intro slides linked above). We alert participants before the workshop as well, and encourage them to start submitting hack ideas to a shared document (though not many do). I think in the future, it would be worthwhile to have a hack development workshop before actually going into the activities described below, but we haven't tried that out yet. The goal here would be to get those with hack ideas to fill out a hack template that asks relevant questions about the project, to be answered before the project can commence. Hack Pitch Preparation: Impromptu Networking When : Directly after the intro about hacking or a hack development workshop Duration : 6 minutes Why : Standing up in front of the entire group and sharing an idea is a daunting task. Some participants might not be sure whether their idea is something they really want to work on, or whether it\u2019s good enough to share. The round of impromptu networking is an opportunity for participants to test out their idea on a small number of individuals first, refine how they present the core objective of their idea, and decide whether they would like to share it with the group. What : Impromptu networking in this iteration only involves only a single question: \u201cWhat is it you\u2019d like to pursue this week?\u201d Each participant is invited to find another person, ideally one they haven\u2019t interacted with yet. Within two minutes, they answer this question to each other, either in the form of a hack idea, or something else they\u2019d like to achieve. This is more free-form in the sense that the other person can ask questions and it can be more of a conversation. We need to remind participants to be mindful of their time and share it with their partner. After two minutes, participants find a new partner and do the same thing again, 3 times in total. Material : Slides Hack Pitches Duration : as needed, about 15-20 minutes Why : At some point, the group needs to know about the different project ideas, so they can pick which they'd like to work on. We haven't found a good way other than asks people to present their ideas to the group, ideally within about 45 seconds each. What : Each participant gets the opportunity to stand up in front and share their hack idea with the group. Ideally, one would start with 3-4 experienced participants to model how this is best done, then asks some of the newer participants to share their ideas, then go back to some experienced participants. During the hack development phase, participants could also write down short descriptions on a set of slides, or fill out paper versions of the hack template. Those that don't want to stand up in front of the group could ask the organizers to pitch either from the slides or from the shared notes. Material : Potentially slides with hack pitches, a microphone Observations and Feedback : Pitching hacks is scary for some participants, and we haven't yet found a way to lower the barrier for those that are uncertain about stepping in front of the group to pitch their idea. This is definitely an area of future development. Hack Sorting Duration : about 30 minutes Why : Once all hacks are pitched, participants need to sort themselves into groups to actually start working on these hacks. Many participants might be interested in more than one hack, and many might not be sure where they want to contribute. This phase of the process allows participants to go around and chat with those that proposed hacks and decide whether they want to work on that particular project for the week. What : Participants who proposed hacks station themselves at different points throughout the room. In four 7-minute intervals, participants can go through the room and check out a hack. We suggest they aim to answer three questions to themselves: What do I want to work on this week? Can I contribute to this project? Do I want to work with this group? After 7 minutes, participants are invited to switch and explore a different hacks. Those that have already decided on a hack may remain with the group, but are asked not to monopolize the conversation with details of the project, but rather allow newcomers to ask questions as well. It is important to remind participants and project leaders to give each other time to ask questions, and not dominate the discussion. Observations and Feedback : The time people needed was very uneven. It is difficult to keep some projects from just going ahead and starting to work. We don't have a good sense at the moment for how to prevent that from happening. Throughout the Hacking One key component of facilitating the hacking is for a designated facilitator to spend the project time looking out for needs that the groups might have. This involves checking in with the different hack teams regularly and ask questions. How are things going? Is the group missing any expertise? Observe the group interactions and find out whether there are participants who are being (unintentionally or not) excluded from group discussions and work. If so, gently steer the group leaderships towards including these participants, or, if necessary, have a discussion with them in private. Also watch out for participants who might be on their own. Ask them how their week is going, whether they need help connecting to a project. Back off if they indicate that they have some work they wish to do on their own. We generally repeat hack pitches every day after lunch. Some hacks finish early, others fail early (we encourage participants to try out new things, and fail quickly), and so new hacks might emerge during the week that are being pitched. These pitch sessions are also an opportunity for teams to ask for help, if they are missing specific expertise to make progress on their project. Wrap-Up When : short wrap-up sessions during the week as needed (usually not on Mondays, but perhaps Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), and then a big final wrap-up session on Friday afternoon. Duration : At least 60 minutes, but longer as needed Why : Sharing outcomes of projects is a big part of the workshop. The wrap-ups provide participants to share outcomes: a scientific result, a tutorial, a software tool, a product, a figure, or simply something they've learned. It is particularly important to encourage participants to share projects that failed . Too often, hackathons showcase the most polished and most shiny result, which can reinforce impostor syndrome. It is important to acknowledge that most hacks fail, and that failed hacks are valuable learning experiences that we encourage to be shared. What : Participants are encouraged to submit a wrap-up slide to a shared presentation that summarizes their project. These wrap-up slides are often written during the last lunch break on Friday, or shortly before the wrap-up begins. Each slide includes a title, the participants that contributed, a short summary (1-2 sentences) and what the outcome was. Often, these slides also include an image or a figure that signifies the outcome. For online projects and software, short (1 minute) demos are also permissible. Participants are then encourage to come to the front and summarize their project to the group (in about 1 minute), while the group cheers. Material : shared presentation with a template slide Feedback Feedback is an important component of the hack week. We don't know if something is going wrong if we don't have a mechanism for people to tell us so! It is helpful to stress at the beginning of the week that feedback is always welcome, and that the organizers are always open to receiving feedback. In addition, we have two mechanisms to allow participants to provide feedback: Feedback Box When : every evening after the hack show-and-tell Duration : <5 minutes Why : getting feedback during the week is important for us to react and adjust quickly. Feedback should be anonymous in order for people to be able to give it more openly. Emphasise that this feedback is important to us, because we\u2019re experimenting with different forms of interactions here and are trying to learn what works/doesn\u2019t work. What : Ask participants to take a post-it, and think about these two questions: \u201cWhat did you observe that worked well today? What would you suggest to improve any part of the day?\u201d Participants can add their sticky notes to an anonymous box that the organizers empty and read each evening. Observations and Feedback : This has worked really well for things that needed adjusting on-the-fly during the workshop. The box needs to be somewhere that is easily accessible to participants, and where they won't be easily exposed as writing a feedback note in order to allow them to feel comfortabel submitting especially critical feedback. Participants have also used this to give positive feedback, which is great for us organizers, both in terms of encouraging us and in terms of helping us know what worked well. Feedback Survey When : Ideally directly after the last lunch break (note: you can run this after the workshop ended, but response rates go down significantly) Duration : about 20-30 minutes Why : The survey enables us to get feedback on a broader range of topics related to Astro Hack Week, and enables us to learn about how participants interact at and with the workshop. We have also been tracking different metrics related to learning, open science and reproducibility across the different years and across different types of hack weeks. In addition, the surveys have been invaluable in improving hack weeks and helping us secure funding in the future. What : a survey on Qualtrics (questions to be finished during the week); participants will be asked to fill out this survey (anonymously) after lunch on the last day, in order to get as large a sample as possible. Material : survey on qualtrics (see the GitHub repository associated with this documentation for a template) Observations and Feedback : the survey has been the single most invaluable resource in helping us adjust and improve the workshop every year. We have received an enormous amount of candid and constructive feedback that has helped us design our facilitation strategies better. In addition, Astro Hack Week runs activities, especially with respect to facilitation, as experiments . We re-design parts of the survey every year in a way that allows us to test whether these experiments have positive or negative outcomes.","title":"Astrohackweek Facilitation"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#facilitation-at-astro-hack-week","text":"Astro Hack Week intentionally spreads itself very wide in terms of the participants we admit, and the projects we encourage participants to work on.

It's also worth nothing that participants come to Astro Hack Week with very different goals: some come primarily to learn, some come to make progress on a specific (PhD) research project, some come to collaborate with specific people, and others want to learn more about how to run a hackathon. The breadth of indv Perhaps the key challenge for us as organizers and facilitators is helping each participant find and contribute to a project that they are both interested in and that matches up with their goals for learning and participation. In addition, not all participants feel equally comfortable participating, and impostor phenomenon is a common occurrence at Astro Hack Week. The goal of facilitation at Astro Hack Week is to provide an environment where all participants feel welcome, accepted and their contributions are valued. With this in mind, each year there is at least one person whose primary task is facilitation. This includes setting the tone of the meeting and framing the community building in the larger context of the goals of the workshop, leading the group through activities such as ice breakers and hack pitches, and going around the room during project time to make sure the teams are functioning well and all participants are able to participate to the level that they wish to. Usually, the person facilitating does not work on a hack themselves (though in 2019, the facilitation was shared between three organizers to allow hack time for each person). The first day is particularly important in the context of facilitating the event. It sets the tone for the rest of the week, and many participants will meet each other for the first time ever. This can be particularly intimidating to junior participants, and so making sure that everyone has the chance to meet others is a core goal. In addition, the design and pitching of projects, as well as the team formation happens on the first afternoon. This, too, requires careful facilitation to ensure the teams are off to a welcoming, healthy and productive start. As organizers, it is very difficult to know what's in the participants' minds, and the participants' lived experience might lead them to react to certain activities very differently than we as organizers expect. We have a number of feedback mechanisms that we have implemented to receive feedback both during the week (which may allow us to make changes immediately) and at the end of the workshop (for implementation during a future event). In addition, it is worth noting that all group activities are framed as invitations : we do not insist that participants take part in events that require social interaction, which would be actively hostile to our participants and also counter-productive. We rather invite participants to take part based on how well they feel able to do so. One notable exception to the rule is the Code of Conduct: we do require all participants to adhere to the Astro Hack Week Code of Conduct, and ask participants to confirm their willingness to do so upon applying to the workshop. With the above considerations in mind, we have implemented some activities to guide participants through Astro Hack Week. These are all based on the following ground rules that we as organizers and facilitators strive to follow and implement during the week: The code of conduct sets the ground rules and minimum standard for all interactions Remind participants repeatedly to think about their interactions, the dynamics within their interactions and groups the space they occupy (relative to others) the distribution of talking time/space to participate Also remind participants to pay particular attention to known dynamics (e.g. with respect to academic seniority, gender, race, \u2026) Do not interrupt speakers (unless they won\u2019t shut up) Encourage questions and give others the benefit of the doubt (don\u2019t tell people \u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t know this!\u201d or something of the sort) Encourage participants to engage critically with and think about how they interact with others","title":"Facilitation at Astro Hack Week"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#story-board","text":"Add story board here!","title":"Story Board"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#detailed-descriptions-of-activities","text":"","title":"Detailed Descriptions of Activities"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#community-building-impromptu-networking","text":"Description : Impromptu Networking When : Very early on, before the first coffee break (as needed potentially every morning) Duration : ~15-20 minutes Why : Provide a non-threatening environment for first interactions between participants, reduce barriers to interactions, gives them a chance to introduce themselves to others and get to know them in a short while. The short amount of time for each interaction reduces the chance for participants to \u201cpanic\u201d about making a good first impression. Also aims to set the tone for the week and get participants to think about their own goals and obstacles for the week. The responses have to be fast, so they\u2019re designed to be stream-of-consciousness and somewhat unpolished. What : Invite everyone to stand up and spread through the room. Ask them to find someone they haven\u2019t met before. They have 120 seconds to introduce themselves to each other and complete the sentence displayed on the slide (see below for examples). After 120 seconds, ring bell and get participants to switch to a new partner, with a new sentence. Repeat ~7-8 times. Remind participants that 120 seconds is short, and that they\u2019re responsible for giving the other person enough time for their answer. Materials : Bell, slides with sentences to be completed. Sample Statements : What first inspired me in this work is \u2026 One thing I\u2019d like to learn this week is \u2026 A challenge I hope we make progress on is \u2026 I belong at Astro Hack Week because \u2026 Something I am proud of is \u2026 Something I plan to give to this community is ... My hope is that people will experience me as \u2026 Astro Hack Week will be a success for me if \u2026 For fun, I \u2026 In my free time, I like to ... When it\u2019s all said and done, all I want is \u2026 Additional statements, if the exercise is repeated in the mornings throughout the week: Yesterday, I learned that \u2026 In my interactions with others, I particularly enjoyed ... Today, I\u2019d like to try to ... Observations and Feedback : Participants took part in this at Astro Hack Week fairly enthusiastically. Not all used the prompts, some just introduced themselves and chatted about what they planned to do this week, and that's perfectly fine, too. There were two important observations and feedback that are relevant for future uses of this activity: Some of the statements might be triggering for participants with social anxiety and mental health issues (e.g. in the first version of this activity one of the prompts read \"A voice I need to stop listening to is ...\"). We've since tried to eliminate those statements, and remain attentive to feedback regarding prompts that might make our participants uncomfortable. One issue with this activity is that 50 people all talking to one another at the same time can get very loud! Ideally, do this activity outside if weather permits, or in a space that allows participants to spread out and that doesn't echo too much. Something that we haven't solved very well so far is how this exercise might work for participants with mobility issues. Because it requires standing and moving about, this might unintentionally exclude some participants. There could be a variant where this exercise involves paired chairs, and only some participants move about. The invitation would be for roughly half of the participants to stand up and find a partner, while the remainder stays seated. In either case, however, it's useful to get participants to move away from the tables they might normally be sitting at and away from their computers, if possible.","title":"Community Building: Impromptu Networking"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#introducing-and-framing-astro-hack-week","text":"When : At the beginning of the week, right after the Impromptu Networking Duration : About 30 minutes Why : Many participants come in with just a vague idea of what Astro Hack Week is and what its goals are. This introduction aims to give participants an overview of the workshop, the practical logistics (schedule, bathrooms, lunches, social events etc.), and especially the rules and expectations for working together and for building an inclusive learning environment. What : About a half-hour presentation by the organizers, covering the elements and structure of the workshop, logistics, the code of conduct and other aspects of working together for the week. At Astro Hack Week, it has been important to us not only to reinforce that the code of conduct is to be followed at all times (both during the workshop itself and social times outside of it), but actively goes into detail how we want participants to behave and interact with one another. This includes welcoming questions and providing useful answers, experimenting with Astro Hack Week itself, trying out something new, listening to each other, respecting each other's pronouns, being kind to one another, and being open to learn about one another, both in terms of technical knowledge as well as from other people's lived experiences. This discussion also includes a note on impostor phenomenon, which we've found to be prevalent at Astro Hack Week.

Because data visualization is one of the less technically complicated topics, and because it allows for many opportunities to practice group interactions, we chose it as a vehicle to also model and practice inclusive group work with our participants. We guided our participants through a series of group activities that allowed them to self-discover important data visualization principles and put them into practice, while also providing them with structures to help them with the project work later.","title":"Building Positive Learning Environments Through a Data Visualization Tutorial"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#community-building-1-2-4-all-for-data-visualization","text":"Description : 1-2-4-all When : at the start of the data visualization tutorial Duration : 20 minutes (silent reflection: 2 minutes, pairs: 4 minutes, groups of 4: 6 minutes, whole group: 8 minutes; see also feedback + observations below ) Why : Best practices and rules are most easily accepted when they are grounded in the students\u2019 own experiences. Especially with data visualization, more than other fields, there is likely a lot of expertise scattered through the room already, and most participants, even students, are likely to have an intuitive sense of whether a particular visualization is effective at communicating information. This exercise is aimed at co-creating best practices for effective data visualization. The secondary goal is to give participants a structure and a framework for group interactions and working in teams, which they may adopt for the free-form hacking later during the day/week, and reinforce good practices for communicating and cooperating. What : Invite participants to sit down next to someone they don\u2019t know. Each participant gets one data visualization to look at: some sample visualizations are fairly competent at communicating information, some are not. Each participant is then asked to answer three questions (see below) in silent reflection (2 minutes). In the next step, participants are grouped in pairs, and discuss their answers, co-creating a common set of best practices (4 minutes). In the third step, groups of four discuss the common set of best practices and (6 minutes) rank them by importance. In groups of four, a pen or crayon will serve as a talking object. Only the person with the object speaks, and each person mentions one rule, then passes on the object. One person has to be a note-taker (for the shared online document). Participants should invite the most junior person to speak first, but they\u2019re free to say \u201cpass\u201d and let someone else begin. Finally, each team shares a practice with the entire group, which a note-taker records in the shared online document. Once each team has had a chance to speak, if there are further best practices, we go through the groups again and allow each group to mention another best practice. Material : pens/crayons, print-outs of data visualizations, set-up of a shared online document Questions : What information does this data visualization convey What does this data visualization do well in communicating information? Can you think of ways in which you would improve this data visualization? What general rules can you derive for communicating information visually? Observations and Feedback : 20 minutes is way too short for this exercise, partly because participants require more time to take in the visualization and answer the questions, but also because they are excited to share their conclusions both in pairs and groups of four. For the second iteration of this exercise, we restricted ourselves to just two data visualizations, and gave roughly half the participants each. I think 45 minutes is a better time estimate for this exercise in total (5 minutes silent contemplation, 10 minutes in pairs, 15 minutes in groups of four, 15 minute for summary with the group). One suggestion has been to give this exercise more practical structure by providing participants a page with 4 quadrants, each signifying one of the questions. The participants are then asked to note down their observations in each quadrant, and circle one observation in each quadrant that stood out to them.","title":"Community Building: 1-2-4 All for Data Visualization"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#community-building-improve-a-data-visualization","text":"When : In general, the 1-2-4-all exercise above is followed by a bit of a lecture-style introduction into some concepts that give the participants a bit of practical background on some of the visualization principles they co-created (e.g. pre-attentive processing, Gestalt psychology). Following this, the participants get the opportunity to take an existing data visualization and improve upon it. Duration : 60 minutes Why : Learning new principles and ideas functions best through practice and trying it out. In this activity, participants will work in teams of 3-4 to take an existing data visualization and improve upon it visually. Again, this structure aims to give participants a framework for how to interact in teams and learn some of these principles of constructive interaction in a non-threatening setting. What : Participants will be asked to team up in groups of 3-4 and pick a data visualization. It can be a plot they have made (voluntary!), or they can pick one of the ones that the instructors bring along. During the first ten minutes, participants identify improvements to be made in the existing visualization, using the same rules as during the group-phase of the 1-2-4-all: each person gets to say one thing, then passes the talking pen off to the next person. A person who would not like to add anything can say \u201cpass\u201d and pass on the pen. Participants should invite the most junior person to speak first, but they\u2019re free to say \u201cpass\u201d and let someone else begin. One person takes notes. Once all the possible improvements have been put onto paper, participants vote on their top 5 improvements (each gets 3 votes), and start collecting ideas for how to improve in a similar manner as before. They take a piece of paper and pin it to the wall, then use the crayons to draw out a sketch of the new visualization. If there is time, they can attempt to create it on a computer, but emphasis here is on creating a prototype together on paper. During the last 15 minutes, a member of each team will share the results with the rest of the groups. Notes : Some of the design elements of this exercise were chosen particularly to enable positive group collaboration and facilitate the best learning outcome. Do not pick figures from your own field as bad examples for visualizations, unless you can be absolutely sure that the author is not in the room (for example, by choosing your own). Having a figure you might have spent weeks on publicly dissected without being warned that this might be happening is absolutely terrifying and has a chilling effect. You do not want this to happen. Thankfully, the internet is full of terrible, professionally produced visualizations for you to pick from. The exercise explicitly uses crayons on paper, because with computer-based exercises, the group can be too easily side-tracked into specific questions of how to plot one particular thing with that specific plotting library. In addition, team members might have different skill levels in computer-based visualization, which may lead to some participants programming, while others sit at the sidelines being excluded from participating. Secondly, we chose to pin paper to the wall specifically because it means that participants are all facing the same way, toward a common goal. This is markedly different from paper that's spread on a table, with people standing around. In the latter case, participants disagreeing with someone else's suggestion do so while facing them, which can feel more confrontative than while everyone is facing the same way towards the paper on the wall. Material : pens/crayons, print-outs of data visualizations, large sheets of paper, tape, empty walls Observations and Feedback : Expect ~10 minutes to pick a figure, ~30 minutes to prototype a figure, and another ~15 minutes to collect the results (depending on group size, of course; this was for ~50 participants). Participants really enjoyed both the figures and the crayons. It made this much more playful and much less intimidating than it would otherwise have been (and some participants noted that specifically in the feedback). One out of ten groups chose to use their own figure instead of one of those I provided. Putting the (empty) posters on the wall was really helpful, I think, because people started talking about the poster, rather than toward each other (which suggested might be less confrontational). We also observed that many participants who didn\u2019t want to share their group\u2019s conclusions during the first exercise participated enthusiastically in the drawing, so it seemed to have succeeded in getting people to interact.","title":"Community Building: Improve a Data Visualization"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#facilitating-the-hacking","text":"The project work component of Astro Hack Week requires careful facilitation in particular, because it is otherwise very free-form and can be very intimidating to new participants and those who are introverted and/or shy. In particular pitching potential projects to the entire group requires a lot of self-confidence in one's ideas and ability to convey them in less than a minute. We start this part of the workshop with a short introduction into what a hack is, and the characteristics of a good hack (see also intro slides linked above). We alert participants before the workshop as well, and encourage them to start submitting hack ideas to a shared document (though not many do). I think in the future, it would be worthwhile to have a hack development workshop before actually going into the activities described below, but we haven't tried that out yet. The goal here would be to get those with hack ideas to fill out a hack template that asks relevant questions about the project, to be answered before the project can commence.","title":"Facilitating the Hacking"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#hack-pitch-preparation-impromptu-networking","text":"When : Directly after the intro about hacking or a hack development workshop Duration : 6 minutes Why : Standing up in front of the entire group and sharing an idea is a daunting task.

The round of impromptu networking is an opportunity for participants to test out their idea on a small number of individuals first, refine how they present the core objective of their idea, and decide whether they would like to share it with the group. What : Impromptu networking in this iteration only involves only a single question: \u201cWhat is it you\u2019d like to pursue this week?\u201d Each participant is invited to find another person, ideally one they haven\u2019t interacted with yet. Within two minutes, they answer this question to each other, either in the form of a hack idea, or something else they\u2019d like to achieve. This is more free-form in the sense that the other person can ask questions and it can be more of a conversation.

What : Each participant gets the opportunity to stand up in front and share their hack idea with the group. Ideally, one would start with 3-4 experienced participants to model how this is best done, then asks some of the newer participants to share their ideas, then go back to some experienced participants. During the hack development phase, participants could also write down short descriptions on a set of slides, or fill out paper versions of the hack template. Those that don't want to stand up in front of the group could ask the organizers to pitch either from the slides or from the shared notes. Material : Potentially slides with hack pitches, a microphone Observations and Feedback : Pitching hacks is scary for some participants, and we haven't yet found a way to lower the barrier for those that are uncertain about stepping in front of the group to pitch their idea.

What : Participants who proposed hacks station themselves at different points throughout the room. In four 7-minute intervals, participants can go through the room and check out a hack. We suggest they aim to answer three questions to themselves: What do I want to work on this week? Can I contribute to this project? Do I want to work with this group? After 7 minutes, participants are invited to switch and explore a different hacks. Those that have already decided on a hack may remain with the group, but are asked not to monopolize the conversation with details of the project, but rather allow newcomers to ask questions as well. It is important to remind participants and project leaders to give each other time to ask questions, and not dominate the discussion. Observations and Feedback : The time people needed was very uneven. It is difficult to keep some projects from just going ahead and starting to work.

This involves checking in with the different hack teams regularly and ask questions. How are things going? Is the group missing any expertise? Observe the group interactions and find out whether there are participants who are being (unintentionally or not) excluded from group discussions and work. If so, gently steer the group leaderships towards including these participants, or, if necessary, have a discussion with them in private. Also watch out for participants who might be on their own. Ask them how their week is going, whether they need help connecting to a project. Back off if they indicate that they have some work they wish to do on their own. We generally repeat hack pitches every day after lunch. Some hacks finish early, others fail early (we encourage participants to try out new things, and fail quickly), and so new hacks might emerge during the week that are being pitched. These pitch sessions are also an opportunity for teams to ask for help, if they are missing specific expertise to make progress on their project.","title":"Throughout the Hacking"},{"location":"Facilitation/AHW-Facilitation/#wrap-up","text":"When : short wrap-up sessions during the week as needed (usually not on Mondays, but perhaps Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), and then a big final wrap-up session on Friday afternoon.

The wrap-ups provide participants to share outcomes: a scientific result, a tutorial, a software tool, a product, a figure, or simply something they've learned. It is particularly important to encourage participants to share projects that failed . Too often, hackathons showcase the most polished and most shiny result, which can reinforce impostor syndrome. It is important to acknowledge that most hacks fail, and that failed hacks are valuable learning experiences that we encourage to be shared. What : Participants are encouraged to submit a wrap-up slide to a shared presentation that summarizes their project. These wrap-up slides are often written during the last lunch break on Friday, or shortly before the wrap-up begins. Each slide includes a title, the participants that contributed, a short summary (1-2 sentences) and what the outcome was. Often, these slides also include an image or a figure that signifies the outcome. For online projects and software, short (1 minute) demos are also permissible.

Here are some ideas for future experimentation: invite people with project ideas to prepare one or two slides in a shared slide repository. The slides should contain brief information on the person's name, their main ideas and goals, and possibly an image to illustrate their ideas.

Despite our efforts to help ease people slowly into this process, for example by inviting people into small group sharing of ideas, this process still requires the individual to get up in front of everyone to talk through what might be an incompletely formed idea in a short amount of time. Here are some ideas for future experimentation: invite people with project ideas to prepare one or two slides in a shared slide repository. The slides should contain brief information on the person's name, their main ideas and goals, and possibly an image to illustrate their ideas. We think this could help people to remember each other's ideas and might minimize anxiety about getting up in front of the room. offer to have an organizing committee member help people get clear on their ideas and possibly act as a surrogate presenter for that person, based on notes or a slide that the person prepares","title":"Hack/Project Pitching"},{"location":"Facilitation/Future-experiments/#complexity-theory","text":"Convey early in the event that we are swimming in a complex (not complicated) space as data scientists.

Hackweeks are a relatively new learning model, so participants may arrive on the first day not knowing quite what to expect. Careful planning of the opening session can help alleviate participant anxiety by establishing a code of conduct and norms of behavior, and setting intentions around building a welcoming learning environment. We detail below a variety of topics and activities that can be included in the opening session. We have experimented with opening sessions lasting as long as 1.5 hours. The length you choose will depend on the total number of activities planned. Welcoming Remarks Usually the event begins with brief opening remarks, often by the lead organizer of the hackweek. Topics in the welcoming remarks may include: acknowledging the substantial time commitment participants are making to attend the event thanking organizers, tutorial leads and guest speakers acknowledging sources of funding speaking briefly about the history, formation and overall mission of the hackweek model talking through logistics of the room setup, timing and location of breaks and meals and the overall schedule of the event Code of Conduct The code of conduct defines the rules and acceptable behaviors of participants during the event. All hackweeks post their code of conduct online ( example code of conduct ) and require participants to have read and agree to these terms before they register for the event. During the opening session we draw everyone's attention to the code of conduct again as a way to emphasize its importance. We recommend providing a handout with the code of conduct listed in writing, and talking through the various options participants have to report a code of conduct violation. Imposter Phenomenon It is common across all levels of technical and academic endeavors to feel as if one's existing knowledge and skill set is below the level of others in their community, and that one doesn't really belong at a particular event. This is a particularly acute challenge at hackweeks where we welcome everyone from beginners to experts, and where we explore tools and approaches that may have just been invented by the open source community (see this blog post for some examples). Because of the complex, rapidly changing nature of data science studies, feeling like an imposter is an extremely common and normal experience for people across all levels of experience. Therefore we prefer to call this experience the \"Imposter Phenomenon\", rather than the more commonly used \"Imposter Syndrome\", because we feel the term \"Syndrome\" suggests a pathology, which goes counter to our assertion that this is a common and normal experience. As shown in our detailed hackweek case studies, different hackweeks have worked to mitigate Imposter Phenomenon in different ways. But common to all of our approaches is the creation of a community space that not only makes it safe to fail, but actually encourages it. We aim to convey the idea that data science studies are complex and require a series of experiments, some of which will succeed, and some of which will fail. We gain as much from the success as the failures as we learn to amplify success and avoid the path to failure in our future experiments.","title":"Opening the Event"},{"location":"Facilitation/event-introduction/#event-introduction","text":"The opening session provides organizers with a unique opportunity to set the overall tone of the event.

In a small group setting we explore skills needed to navigate technical and social challenges of building collaborative relationsihps with the aim of solving complex challenges. Research shows that this collaborative work increases the liklihood for innovation and creativity. Our wiki pages provide in-depth project guidelines and details on project management . Here we offer ideas on how to facilitate the project work so that participants can make the best use of their time. Forming Project Teams One of the biggest challenges in getting started on the projects is deciding which project to join. One approach to pitching and selecting projects that has worked well across multiple hackweeks is described below. Introduction to Projects and Hacking We begin with a short presentation describing the purpose of the projects. We remind participants that this is not an activity that will be graded, and that learning the process of collaborative software development is more important than generating any specific products or outcomes at the end of the week. We talk through the various roles and responsibilities of project team and data science leads, as well as of each individual in the group. We also describe the appropriate scope and depth of the projects, and talk about the collaboration tools to be used during the week. Generating Project Ideas Participants are now given some time to brainstorm on project ideas. We use either Impromptu Networking or 1-2-4-All , using an invitation such as, \"What data science challenge would you like to make progress on this week?\", or \"What problem could this group make progress on in the coming days?\". This session should last 20-30 minutes, giving people enough time to share ideas and gain additional clarity on an idea that might have been brewing for some time. Project Pitching After having a series of conversations we invite anyone who is ready to pitch an idea to come to the front of the room. First we have an instructor model the project pitch, which should be succinct, clear, and have a duration under one minute. At the end of the pitch we ask the person for a one word project name, which we then write on a large sticky note. One instructor also takes notes on a whiteboard so everyone can keep track of ideas being presented. Team Formation Each person who pitched an idea now takes their large sticky note and finds an area in the room to post the note, effectively setting up a temporary station where additional conversations can be conducted. Participants are then invited to walk to any station that interests them so that they can find out more information. This structure is a condensed version of Shift and Share and generally lasts 20-30 minutes. Often during this process, small teams will recognize areas of overlap with other teams and may decide to merge. Or, teams that have a lot of interest might split into a series of smaller teams. Generally the optimum team size is 4-7 people, but we have had smaller and larger teams that have worked as well. At this time, anyone who is still looking for a team can consult with an organizer and have additional discussions to aid their decision process. Team Introductions Once teams are formed they gather together at a chosen location to begin working together. We invite each team to begin by getting to know each other. Waterhackweek accomplished this by having \"Participant Bios\" prepared in advance that included a picture of the participant, their name and institution, and space to write about their background and coding experience. Two additional prompts on the page were: \"I want to contribute...\" and \"I want to focus my learning on...\". These forms were then shared within each team as a way to accelerate connections and minimize the liklihood that individuals get left out of group activities. Developing Positive Team Interactions The first few hours of a team's interactions can be critical in setting the tone for effective communication and collaboration. What often occurs is teams begin diving into the details, perhaps out of an excitement for the material they are working on. Or, there may be one team member who is particularly vocal and who may, intentionally or not, dominate the early phases of the project time. We recommend that the data science and project team leads should play an active role in facilitating the development of team interactions that include everyone on the team, and that help people rapidly find project activites that align with their skills.","title":"Pitching Hacks/Projects"},{"location":"Facilitation/pitching-hacks/#hackweek-projects","text":"The purpose of hackweek projects is for participants to gain hands-on experience in working together on a well-defined problem.

It may be tempting and straightforward to select candidates that are known personally to the committee as good citizens of the community, but we strongly warn organizers that taking this approach might run counter several goals that a hack week might have. General Notes on the Selection Strategy In any approach, participant selection begins with a clear articulation of the goals of the workshop, and how participant selection might serve these goals. Possible goals are: * teaching data science methods to a wide range of researchers in your domain * encouraging collaborations between researchers of different fields * encouraging collaborations between researchers in different stages of their careers * improving access to modern methods and tools for researchers from underrepresented groups These are just examples: the goals of your workshop will necessarily depend on your community and its needs. In the ideal case, the formulated goals lead to a clear strategy for selecting participants. For example, a workshop that targets early-career researchers and is more teaching-oriented may wish to preferentially admit graduate students and postdocs, whereas a workshop aimed at collaboration across career stages may prefer to mix career stages more broadly. Similarly, organizers should articulate a strategy for assessing whether candidates have the appropriate skill level and are likely to participate in a way that creates a welcoming community for the group as a whole. We warn organizers to approach this part of the selection procedure very carefully: it is here that unconscious biases are most likely to derail a fair and equitable selection procedure. We recommend that organizers articulate a set of desirable traits and behaviours required in order to achieve a successful hack week, and then design questions that directly probe the participants' ideas about issues surrounding learning and collaboration. Ideally, multiple members of the committee rate each applicant according to a rubric. The resulting scores may then be combined in different ways and interrogated for uncoscious biases. Because no procedure, no matter how well designed, will be entirely bias-free and a hundred percent predictive, ranking participants and admitting according to ranking is unlikely to produce a balanced and unbiased cohort. It may be more advisable to set a reasonable cut-off score of some form (for example, all participants that are acceptable must at least have been given a score of 3 out of five by all reviewers), and then select within that set of acceptable candidates according to other criteria important to the workshop (for example, as mentioned in the example above, the mix of career stage). It may make sense to pre-select a subset of participants at this stage that all reviewers strongly agree on, but again we recommend against selecting all participants this way. A tool that we have successfully used in our hack weeks for the latter step--selection of the cohort out of a set of acceptable candidates, subject to multiple constraints--is called Entrofy . The accompanying notebook shows an example procedure for cohort selection, using a simulated data set. Organizers are encouraged to adapt this notebook to their own needs. Application Questions Here, we aim to present some guidance regarding the design of the application form. It is important that the details of the selection procedure are discussed and agreed upon before designing the application form. The key reason why this is necessary is simple: you cannot select on any attribute or skill you have not asked the candidates about! This has been an issue for all of us in our initial hack weeks: we realized during the selection that we needed information that we had not asked the candidates to provide. This is also the primary reason why organizers should think carefully about their goals while designing the selection procedure.

This is also the primary reason why organizers should think carefully about their goals while designing the selection procedure.","title":"Application Questions"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#general-questions","text":"name e-mail address (don't forget this! you need to contact your candidates somehow!) institution","title":"General Questions"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#questions-probing-motivation-and","text":"","title":"Questions Probing Motivation and"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#demographic-questions","text":"","title":"Demographic Questions"},{"location":"Timeline/Timeline-Intro/","text":"Timeline and Checklist for Hack Weeks This is a very briefly worded checklist for organizers of hack weeks, based on the supplementary materials of the hack weeks paper These are suggestions that we\u2019ve found helpful in the past. Feel free to adapt and change according to your needs! About 1-1.5 years in advance Form a Scientific and Local Organizing Committee(s) Define the different roles required for successful organization: e.g. building a website, coordinating tutorial leads, corresponding with participants, advertising the event, coordinating with local staff (about rooms, catering etc), facilitation during the event Build a team that is distributed in expertise and interests across these roles Elect a \"cat herder in chief\": a person who makes sure the team is on track, online calls get scheduled and reminders are sent out. Make sure things get done: a. Define all roles b. Build a roadmap for completion of tasks c. Assign tasks to team members Establish rules for working together (e.g. a code of conduct among the committee) Settle on team communication (asynchronous communication via slack/e-mail? Regular online calls?) Objectives Figure out your motivation for organizing a hack week. What drives the need for a hack week? a. What are the objectives of a hack week? Set the objectives and goals: b. What do you want participants to produce? c. What do you want participants to have learned? d. How/where/in what form do you want participants to connect with each other? e. What other possible goals could you have during a hack week Prepare for Feedback + Evaluation a. Are there certain goals (or possibly requirements from a funding agency) with respect to evaluation of the workshop? Clarify those goals early on! b. If any scientific research is planned in any way in relation to the hack week, this is the time to initiate the procedures for ethical research (depending on country/institution; in the US this is run by an Institutional Review Board)! In most countries, any human subject research must be cleared by the ethics board of the institution! Do this! Location + Venue Determine country/city for your hack week a. Are there visa requirements for the country? b. How easy/difficult is it to travel to/from this location? c. Is the country the location is in restrictive in any way or unsafe for certain participants (e.g. participants of colour, LGBT participants, participants from certain countries, \u2026) d. What is accommodation like in this country/city? e. How good is the public transport in the chosen location? f. How expensive are travel + accommodation + food in the proposed location? Is this financially accessible to students and participants from institutions with less funding? g. What is the environment like with respect to your field? Is there a significant local presence (might not be important, but could be!) h. Is there something for participants to do outside of the hack week (may be a plus or minus, depending on whether you want participants to work together all the time) i. What is available in terms of families, child support, \u2026 ? j. Is the location known to have tech industry? This may only matter if you\u2019re interested in connecting with local companies and/or ask them for funding. Venue: Considerations for facilitating hacking a. What are the venue\u2019s costs? Is there local funding available that might come with the venue? b. How large is the room? Probably want a room that\u2019s at least \u2153 larger than technically needed for the number of people (so a hack week with 50 people should be in a room advertised for 65 or so) c. Are there separate rooms, or one big one? Separate rooms might facilitate break-outs, but make it harder to keep the group together and allow for work across projects d. What is the set-up for the room? Lecture theatre-style or tables? Theatre-stype is terrible for collaboration, so try not to spend (too much) time in a lecture theatre e. Are components of the room moveable and can chairs/tables be reconfigured? Reconfiguring helps with flexible group formation and interactive work. f. How many white boards/chalk boards are there? Depending on group size, probably want more than 3 g. How many projectors are there? You need at least 1 that\u2019s visible from the entire room. h. Power outlets! Need lots of them i. Internet: high-speed internet is crucial for many data-related tasks Venue: General Considerations a. Does the venue require an application (e.g. the Lorentz Centre)? If so, check application procedures + deadlines >1 year in advance! b. Is the space accessible? Can people with physical disabilities move freely (e.g. participants with wheelchairs, blind participants, \u2026)? Are there elevators or only stairs? c. Are bathrooms gender-neutral or can they be made gender-neutral? Is there administrative support in terms of practical organization (e.g. handling reimbursement claims, ordering lunch/coffee/rooms, assisting with accommodation, ...)? This can be a huge help to the SOC! d. How far away is the venue from available accommodation? e. Is there coffee/tea? f. Advertise location/venue as soon as possible once you know the dates and location (e.g. via the AAS Astrostatistics Working Group, this list of astronomy meetings, the Astrostatistics + Astroinformatics Portal, e-mail lists, local universities, everyone you know, \u2026) Funding A hack week requires funding for a number of different costs: rooms (not always), lunch, coffee, travel funding for some of the participants, potentially salaries for organizers and especially administrative staff, and of course some incidentals. Do rooms need to be paid for extra? This is often the case e.g. in the US! Check this! What are available governmental funding sources? (multi-)national agencies (NIH, NASA, ERC, \u2026): this funding probably needs an application >1 year in advance of the event Are there private foundations that might be willing to provide funding (e.g. Moore and Sloan Foundations)? Make contact + check procedures >1 year in advance Are there other local funding sources available (e.g. does the university/venue have funding or come with funding attached to the workshop)? Are there private companies you can ask for funding? Check the local tech scene! In the past, local offices of Google, IBM, Galvanize, and GitHub have all provided funding to AstroHackWeek How much funding do you intend to reserve for travel grants to participants? How does your funding from different sources match up with different funding needs (sometimes, funding sources come with conditions for what can/cannot be funded)? How much are you likely to charge for registration? Charging a small amount for registration helps participants buy into coming (people are more likely to attend if they\u2019ve put down money for it), but charging a large amount will make the meeting inaccessible Check how to collect registration fees! In most countries, this may require an entity that can deal with the tax implications of having people give you money! If at all possible, try to convince the hosting venue or your university to deal with this! About 1 year to 6 months in advance Website Prepare a Website : this should be done early on, definitely as soon as the hack week is announced. a. What? Why? Where? How? b. Who are the organizers? c. Who is speaking (if you know it already)? d. What is the schedule (if you know it already)? e. Local information: travel + transport, hotel(s), food options f. Contact information for the SOC g. Information about live stream, code of conduct, \u2026 h. (Link to application form, once it\u2019s live) Set up an e-mail address as point of contact for potential participants Set up a mailing list for announcements that interested researchers can sign up for. Announce the event Where are typical venues for announcing events in your community? Prepare e-mail to colleagues + mailing list Reach out to communities traditionally underserved in your field (e.g. community colleges, minority working groups within your professional societies) Participant Selection Important note : This is one of the most important parts of preparing the workshop, so it deserves ample time and consideration. Be aware that there are systematic biases likely present in every part of this! E.g. participants from certain backgrounds might have had fewer opportunities to learn certain skills (like coding), so requiring a certain amount of coding skills might disadvantage certain groups inadvertently! If you require things like motivational statements and/or letters of reference, be aware of biases in recommendation letters, and things like biases related to English language ability. Fundamentally, be aware that there might be biases in the process, and work to mitigate those biases wherever you can! Any information you need for your selection process must be assessed during the application stage. This might seem obvious, but there\u2019s always a question we forget to include. Have a detailed conversation about what the ideal mix of participants is: a. Are there prerequisites for attending the workshop (e.g. a minimum level of coding ability)? b. Are there particular groups that are targeted by the workshop? What are possible axes of selection (e.g. motivation to attend, career stage, geographic origin, skills in a certain subject, demographic variables like gender identity, race, ethnicity, \u2026)? a. Should there be a selection for merit? Think about ways to assess the categories of selection carefully. Any category for selection needs to be translated into some question or application material that can be provided by participants (e.g. CV? Statement of purpose? Letters of recommendation?) a. What are local rules and laws (university/country) around asking about demographic variables? (note that asking participants to disclose personal demographic information should always be voluntary!) b. Asking participants to self-assess skill levels is difficult and fraught with biases. If you ask people whether they\u2019re an \u201cexpert\u201d, \u201cintermediate\u201d or \u201cbeginner\u201d at a certain skill, it\u2019s hard to figure out what \u201cexpert\u201d means for any given person. Try to tie categories to explicit milestones (e.g. \u201cI have edited a python script written by others\u201d, \u201cI have written my own Python script\u201d, \u201cI maintain several open-source packages\u201d, \u2026) Set up an application form: need to figure out what the best way to collect data is (e.g. a google form, \u2026); be aware if there are local/institutional rules about data collection Open form + advertise workshop + application (~10 months ahead of time, leave open for at least 8 weeks!) a. During this time, make sure that the registration procedure/form is set up and that funding is in place: funding must be in place by the time participants are being accepted! b. Make sure there is a back-up (ideally several back-ups) for your collected participant data. If you lose it, it\u2019s gone and you\u2019re in trouble! Build infrastructure for selecting participants and decide on decision procedures: a. Ask committee members to rate applicants? Need to set up categories and scoring rubrics for grading + decision metrics for selection! b. Use an algorithm? Here\u2019s one you could use: https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/entrofy c. Combine both? Run participant selection (ideally ~6 months before the workshop, to give participants ample time to make travel plans and apply for visas) Notify participants of selection, give them a timeline for responding (especially if the workshop is oversubscribed, you might want to give them ~2 weeks so that you can rapidly admit alternative participants for those that drop out) Iterate as participants decline/accept + run registration for those that accept Assign funding, make sure the reimbursement procedure is clear (are people reimbursed and how? Or is the venue booking for the participants?), and inform participants how their travel/childcare expenses will be reimbursed 6 months before the workshop Code of Conduct : As organizing committee, decide what acceptable/inacceptable behaviour looks like for your workshop, and how you can work towards being welcoming to all participants (including shy participants, participants from underrepresented groups, \u2026), and settle on a Code of Conduct a. Note : it is also possible to use part of the time for participants to co-create a code of conduct for the group, but this needs to be carefully facilitated. Find and prep tutorial speakers (if you run tutorials). We know by experience that it is not straightforward even for good teachers to prepare a tutorial for a hack week. Be sure to give tutorials speakers guidance on what you would like them to talk about, and what the appropriate level is (lower than they might expect!) Build a facilitation plan . Group activities (how participants get to know each other, how they pitch hacks, figure out groups and then work in those groups, how they work together during tutorials) work better when actively facilitated, i.e. when there are helpful structures imposed or suggested by the organizers. This is especially important to allow shy participants or more junior researchers participate fully. Work out this plan in advance. This is also your chance to experiment with new ways for people to interact/work with each other! 3-0 months before the workshop Set up a live stream (if one is to be run). Depending on the venue, this can be either trivially easy or nearly impossible. If you are heavily oversubscribed and intend to include outside researchers via a live stream, be sure to figure out the details early. Settle on modes of communication . How do you want participants to communicate with each other? Is slack appropriate? Set up the infrastructure for the tutorials, break-outs, hacking, and other activities you want to run a. Tutorials: you could host them on GitHub and ask tutorial teachers to upload tutorials there (do this in advance so they don\u2019t host it somewhere else!) b. Hack week products: make a public folder where participants can dump things produced at the hack week (though also encourage them to upload to e.g. GitHub) c. Hack idea doc: it\u2019s useful to have a central doc where participants can add ideas for a hack and ideally discuss them in comments d. Wrap-up slides: make a shared slideshow where participants can add their wrapup-slides e. Set up ways for participants to communicate and coordinate online (and for outside researchers to connect): e.g. Slack f. Twitter hashtag? Potentially set up a shared software environment for participants. If the hack week tutorials involve a lot of coding in one language, it can be helpful to set up a shared environment (e.g. vial JupyterHub or Docker) for all participants to use, in order to minimize installation issues. Send welcome e-mail to participants with important information about the workshop, the Code of Conduct, travel arrangements etc. It is also useful to encourage them at this point to start adding ideas for hacks and break-outs in the respective documents. Set up a basic evaluation survey. Set up questions on parts of the hack week you want to receive feedback on. Ideally do this before the hack week, otherwise this might cause some stress during the week itself! During the Hack Week Important note: do not try to hack and facilitate at the same time . 1-2 organizers should be designated facilitators, and their main job should be to keep the hack week running. Trying to both hack and facilitate is very, very difficult and likely not go well. 1. Facilitate, facilitate, facilitate . One of the main jobs during the hack week is to make sure everyone is working in the mode that works best for them. Make sure that participants feel comfortable approaching others about contributing to their hacks, that the groups are working well, that there are no interpersonal problems. 2. Keep in touch with tutorial speakers: make sure they\u2019re prepared and have all they need 3. Ask participants to acknowledge the hack week in publications, software, etc. This can be done for example in the acknowledgment section of a paper, or with a hashtag on GitHub. 4. Set up a break-out board and keep track of which break-outs have a lot of votes a. You also need to find people to teach; be mindful of participants\u2019 time and don\u2019t overburden few of your more experienced participants with too many break-outs 5. Encourage experienced participants to help with the tutorial of the day, to keep them engaged with material they already know 6. Run regular check-in session (pitches, wrap-ups) 7. Be aware of impostor phenomenon being present at your event, and take steps to mitigate it a. Careful facilitation can help b. High representation of otherwise underrepresented groups may make minority participants less like an outsider and help mitigate impostor phenomenon c. Stating its existence and prevalence in the beginning can help participants feel less alone with these emotions 8. Run the survey at the end of the week. It is super helpful to run the survey on the last day, because participation drops very sharply once participants have left. Set aside a little bit of time for participants to fill out the survey. 9. Keep notes on experiences and observations during the week. What seems to work well? What didn\u2019t? What was missing? What could you try next time? After the Hack Week Evaluation Evaluate the results of the survey. Take the survey results and find out what participants actually said about the hack week. Distill some first ideas and conclusions for next time. Debrief . Set a meeting with the organizing committee to debrief after the hack week (ideally in the following two weeks, such that organizers had some time to think about it, but also not so far that they forget). Go through their debrief notes and the survey results, and note down changes to be made or experiments to be run the next year. Keep track of output (papers, software, websites, news articles, blog posts, \u2026). This is useful information to keep track of one axis of usefulness of the hack week, and also useful for future funding applications and reports Report Write a wrap-up report . Check whether any of your funding sources require a report, and write one if they do using the information gathered during this evaluation stage Committee Start choosing the committee for the next year.","title":"Timeline and Checklist for Hack Weeks"},{"location":"Timeline/Timeline-Intro/#timeline-and-checklist-for-hack-weeks","text":"This is a very briefly worded checklist for organizers of hack weeks, based on the supplementary materials of the hack weeks paper These are suggestions that we\u2019ve found helpful in the past.

Ideally do this before the hack week, otherwise this might cause some stress during the week itself!","title":"3-0 months before the workshop"},{"location":"Timeline/Timeline-Intro/#during-the-hack-week","text":"Important note: do not try to hack and facilitate at the same time . 1-2 organizers should be designated facilitators, and their main job should be to keep the hack week running. Trying to both hack and facilitate is very, very difficult and likely not go well. 1. Facilitate, facilitate, facilitate . One of the main jobs during the hack week is to make sure everyone is working in the mode that works best for them. Make sure that participants feel comfortable approaching others about contributing to their hacks, that the groups are working well, that there are no interpersonal problems. 2. Keep in touch with tutorial speakers: make sure they\u2019re prepared and have all they need 3. Ask participants to acknowledge the hack week in publications, software, etc. This can be done for example in the acknowledgment section of a paper, or with a hashtag on GitHub. 4. Set up a break-out board and keep track of which break-outs have a lot of votes a. You also need to find people to teach; be mindful of participants\u2019 time and don\u2019t overburden few of your more experienced participants with too many break-outs 5. Encourage experienced participants to help with the tutorial of the day, to keep them engaged with material they already know 6. Run regular check-in session (pitches, wrap-ups) 7. Be aware of impostor phenomenon being present at your event, and take steps to mitigate it a. Careful facilitation can help b. High representation of otherwise underrepresented groups may make minority participants less like an outsider and help mitigate impostor phenomenon c. Stating its existence and prevalence in the beginning can help participants feel less alone with these emotions 8. Run the survey at the end of the week. It is super helpful to run the survey on the last day, because participation drops very sharply once participants have left. Set aside a little bit of time for participants to fill out the survey. 9. Keep notes on experiences and observations during the week. What seems to work well? What didn\u2019t? What was missing?

There are two key components to discussing the venue: the location (i.e. the country, city and location within the city) that the physical venue is located in, and the venue itself, i.e. the room or rooms where most of the interactions will take place. Below, we will discuss each in turn. Here, like with all parts of hack week organization, accessibility and inclusion are the key considerations that should come first. Location In organizing a hack week events are faced with opportunities and constraints related to the overall physical location of the venue. For example, it may be easier for an organizer to reserve rooms at their local university, or funding agencies might have restrictions on where the event can take place. There are, however, larger considerations that should play a role when deciding on a venue. For example, it may be difficult to impossible for participants from certain countries to obtain travel visas for the US and some European countries. Organizing a workshop in these countries may therefore exclude an entire group of potential participants. Similarly, flights to certain locations may be particularly expensive and/or cumbersome, requiring multi-day travel for the majority of participants. This, in turn, may exclude participants e.g. with childcare responsibilities, who do not want to spend an extra 3-4 days travelling, or participants for whom long travel is otherwise challenging. There is some trade-off: large cities often have more direct flights (and often also cheaper flights) available, but accommodation may be particularly expensive. This may present a challenge for participants from institutions or countries where funding for conference travel is scarce. Fundraising a significant amount of travel funding through sponsorships and grants can alleviate some of the financial concerns, and in some places, university accommodation might be available for much less cost than a hotel room would cost. Organizing the workshop early, with participant selection being completed somewhere around five months before the start of the workshop can also alleviate both costs and visa issues. Organizers should be prepared to provide some support (e.g. invitation letters) to participants requiring visas. In addition to accommodation and travel, it is worth asking how accessible the city where the hack week is located is to different foreigners. For example, a small town in France or Germany may be difficult to navigate for participants who do not speak those languages. Many old European cities have uneven cobblestone streets and buildings (especially restaurants or bars) made inaccessible by stairs, which may present a problem for particpants with mobility issues. On the other hand, organizing the workshop in a location with frequent, reliable and accessible public transport is a an advantage, particularly for participants who can not or will not drive a car. Different countries have different attitudes and laws about certain groups of people, and it is important to ask in advance whether the chosen venue will be safe for the participants. For example, organizing a hack week in a country with anti-LBTQ laws excludes these participants from the start. To summarize, some relevant characteristics to check upon are: * Ease of obtaining travel visas + entry to the country at the border * Ease and expense of travel to/from location * Is the chosen venue safe for all participants, especially those belonging to minority groups? * Ease and expense of obtaining accommodation * Ease of communication for participants who do not speak the local language * Accessibility of the chosen location (for example, are the majority of buildings accessible to participants with mobility aids? Are braille signs widely available?) * Is public transport, wide-spread, frequent, reliable and accessible? We have so far not found a single location that agrees with all of those points. For recurring events, it may be a good idea to move the event around, in order to improve accessibility to different groups. One potential solution could also be to organize not one, but multiple events at the same time in different parts of the world, linked through e.g. dedicated video chatrooms, asynchronous chat organizations and other technological means. Especially for heavily oversubscribed workshops, this might allow a wider range of people to participate in these events. As of now, none of the hack weeks has tried this, though some (especially Astro Hack Week) are considering this model. Characteristics of the ideal Hack Week Venue The considerations above are meant to help organizers ask general questions about who will and who will not be able to attend the workshop, given the chosen location. However, ensuring that participants can physically attend the hack week is only the first step in providing a welcomin and inclusive venue for the hack week. The second set of considerations concerns the venue itself, i.e. the building and the room or rooms where the workshop will take place in practice. As with the discussion about the general location above, there are fundamental questions to ask about whether a venue is not just accessible, but actively welcoming to all participants. Can participants with mobility aids freely access the building without help? Are there signs and sound signals that help vision-impaired participants navigate the space? Are there gender-neutral bathrooms? Making sure that all participants feel welcome in the space where the workshop takes place is the first step towards building an inclusive learning community and workshop. Hack weeks live in part from the shared excitement and energy of working towards a set of common goals for a fixed, short amount of time. Having a central room where teams can work helps generate and sustain that energy. At the same time, these spaces can be loud and chaotic, which might actively impede progress during certain phases of a project, or be fundamentally unsuited to some participants. Having break-out rooms where teams can retreat for focused work in a quieter atmosphere is hugely beneficial, especially when those rooms are still physically connected in some way to the main location (e.g. visually through glass walls). For example, Astro Hack Week 2018 took place at the Lorentz Center in Leiden (NL). The venue provided a large room for about 50 participants as the main venue, in addition to a large coffee and break-out room, as well as shared office space for all participants. These spaces were all physically in close proximity, allowing project teams to spread out and work in whatever environment was most beneficial to their project and team culture. In addition, many participants may require some quiet time. A recent conference had a room designated as Introvert Alley , a room for quiet rest and relaxation, where participants could quietly read or work for a while. It should be made clear, however, that these spaces are not meant e.g. for participants to take phone calls, which might disturb other participants present. Beyond considerations related to accessibility, organizers should ask whether the space is designed for project work. For example, traditional lecture theatres are often set up in such a way that every participants faces the front of the room, and often tables and chairs are bolted to the floor. In these spaces, collaborative group work is difficult because it is difficult for participants to gather and work in groups. The ideal space for tutorials and project work is flexible and reconfigurable. For example, tables and chairs on wheels allow participants to quickle reconfigure the space according to their needs. Because project teams tend to spread out, it can be helpful to plan for a room that's about 1/3 larger than the designated group size (for example, one may want to book a room that can accomodate 65 participants for a group that is 50 participants large). Aside from the ability to reconfigure the room, there are several practical considerations: an ample supply of power outlets are crucial for workshops where the majority of projects will make heavy use of computers. Rooms where projects take place should also provide an ample supply of writeable surfaces, such as white boards or glass walls. Tutorials often involve slides or live-demos using a computer. Organizers should ensure that all participants can easily see the screen where the slides or demo are projected. For the hack weeks, we have often found it beneficial to provide coffee, tea, biscuits and lunch to participants during coffee and lunch breaks. These are valuable opportunities for participants to interact in an informal way, and providing coffee and lunch breaks in-house avoids the group breaking up into smaller sub-groups of people who already knew each other in advance. However, not all spaces allow food and drink: organizers should ensure that their spaces allow coffee and lunch to be provided close to or at the hack week venue. Several hack weeks have made use of the Active Learning Classrooms in the Odegaard Undergraduate Library at the University of Washington. These are interactive, collaborative spaces comprising a set of tables each seating nine participants, with power outlets for each participant in the center of the table. Each table also has its own screen, and the overall system allows the connection from any table to display either on that screen specifically, or project to all screens simultaneously. This allows all participants to follow along with tutorials regardless of where they sit, and also makes sharing results during the wrap-up easy. In addition, the room has small alcoves for about four participants along one wall, allowing for smaller group work in a somewhat sheltered space. These alcoves have tables and walls that are writeable, and the walls around the rooms can be used as whiteboards as well. These active learning class rooms are a great example of a space designed for interactive tutorials and project work, although they do lack break-out rooms that are physically separated enough to reduce noise and distraction. While food and drink were not allowed in the room itself, coffee and lunch could be served right outside. To summarize, here are some general considerations for the hack week venue: * Are the building and the rooms accessible and welcoming to all students? * Does the room in principle accommodate a somewhat larger number of participants than is projected to attend? * Is the room easily reconfigurable to address different needs during tutorials and project work? * Are there power outlets that are easily accessible to all participants? * Is there ample board space for writing, designing, and sketching out ideas? * Is there a system in place for displaying slides and tutorials, and is the screen visible from everywhere in the room? * Are there separate rooms where teams can withdraw for focused work? * Can one of those rooms be designated as a room for quiet time, to allow participants to temporarily withdraw from the controlled chaos of the hack week? * Does the venue allow food and drink either within the rooms or in close proximity?","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Venues/Venues-General/#venues-for-participant-driven-events","text":"The details of the space where the workshop takes place are often overlooked when organizing scientific workshops, but has in practice a huge effect on the dynamics and the success of a workshop, especially on participant-driven events like hack weeks (for a discussion about how physical spaces are key to data science collaborations, see also the MSDSE Report ).
