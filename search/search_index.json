It may be tempting and straightforward to select candidates that are known personally to the committee as good citizens of the community, but we strongly warn organizers that taking this approach might run counter several goals that a hack week might have. General Notes on the Selection Strategy In any approach, participant selection begins with a clear articulation of the goals of the workshop, and how participant selection might serve these goals. Possible goals are: * teaching data science methods to a wide range of researchers in your domain * encouraging collaborations between researchers of different fields * encouraging collaborations between researchers in different stages of their careers * improving access to modern methods and tools for researchers from underrepresented groups These are just examples: the goals of your workshop will necessarily depend on your community and its needs. In the ideal case, the formulated goals lead to a clear strategy for selecting participants. For example, a workshop that targets early-career researchers and is more teaching-oriented may wish to preferentially admit graduate students and postdocs, whereas a workshop aimed at collaboration across career stages may prefer to mix career stages more broadly. Similarly, organizers should articulate a strategy for assessing whether candidates have the appropriate skill level and are likely to participate in a way that creates a welcoming community for the group as a whole. We warn organizers to approach this part of the selection procedure very carefully: it is here that unconscious biases are most likely to derail a fair and equitable selection procedure. We recommend that organizers articulate a set of desirable traits and behaviours required in order to achieve a successful hack week, and then design questions that directly probe the participants' ideas about issues surrounding learning and collaboration. Ideally, multiple members of the committee rate each applicant according to a rubric. The resulting scores may then be combined in different ways and interrogated for uncoscious biases. Because no procedure, no matter how well designed, will be entirely bias-free and a hundred percent predictive, ranking participants and admitting according to ranking is unlikely to produce a balanced and unbiased cohort. It may be more advisable to set a reasonable cut-off score of some form (for example, all participants that are acceptable must at least have been given a score of 3 out of five by all reviewers), and then select within that set of acceptable candidates according to other criteria important to the workshop (for example, as mentioned in the example above, the mix of career stage). It may make sense to pre-select a subset of participants at this stage that all reviewers strongly agree on, but again we recommend against selecting all participants this way. A tool that we have successfully used in our hack weeks for the latter step--selection of the cohort out of a set of acceptable candidates, subject to multiple constraints--is called Entrofy . The accompanying notebook shows an example procedure for cohort selection, using a simulated data set. Organizers are encouraged to adapt this notebook to their own needs. Application Questions Here, we aim to present some guidance regarding the design of the application form. It is important that the details of the selection procedure are discussed and agreed upon before designing the application form. The key reason why this is necessary is simple: you cannot select on any attribute or skill you have not asked the candidates about! This has been an issue for all of us in our initial hack weeks: we realized during the selection that we needed information that we had not asked the candidates to provide. This is also the primary reason why organizers should think carefully about their goals while designing the selection procedure.
