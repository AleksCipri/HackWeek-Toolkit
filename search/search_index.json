Hackweeks are a relatively new learning model, so participants may arrive on the first day not knowing quite what to expect. Careful planning of the opening session can help alleviate participant anxiety by establishing a code of conduct and norms of behavior, and setting intentions around building a welcoming learning environment. We detail below a variety of topics and activities that can be included in the opening session. We have experimented with opening sessions lasting as long as 1.5 hours. The length you choose will depend on the total number of activities planned. Welcoming Remarks Usually the event begins with brief opening remarks, often by the lead organizer of the hackweek. Topics in the welcoming remarks may include: acknowledging the substantial time commitment participants are making to attend the event thanking organizers, tutorial leads and guest speakers acknowledging sources of funding speaking briefly about the history, formation and overall mission of the hackweek model talking through logistics of the room setup, timing and location of breaks and meals and the overall schedule of the event Icebreaker Hackweeks are designed to be highly interactive experiences, so we try to get people talking with each other early in the event. A well designed icebreaker can help participants explore connections with people they do not yet know, and get people thinking creatively about what they hope to accomplish during the event. Good icebreakers create a hospitable space for connection and conversation, while poorly conecived icebreakers put people on the spot and create a stressful social interaction, which should be avoided this early in the event. As with all facilitated activities, participants should be made aware that their involvement is by invitation and is not a required component of the event. Impromptu Networking The purpose of impromput networking is to invite one-on-one conversation with people in the room you have not yet met. Participants are invited to find a partner and have each person speak for two minutes in response to a question provided by the organizer. The question should be displayed in large font on the projector for eveyone to see. Questions we have tried in past events include: \"What would you like to get from and give to this community in the coming week?\" \"What data science challenge are you most interested in exploring right now?\" \"What is the most important thing you would like to accomplish this week?\" This activity usually occurs in three rounds. After speaking with one person during the 4 minutes provided, the organizer indicates it is time to find a new person (for example by ringing chimes), and the conversation begins again in response to the same question. While it may seem redundant to keep repeating your response to the same question, this repetition often leads to greater depth as you become more and more clear in your response. Mad Tea Mad tea involves arranging participants in two concentric circles, with the inside circle facing outward, and the outside circle facing inward. Participants are invited to respond to a series of questions that should be posted in large fonts on a screen(s) that can be seen by everyone. Participants respond to the question in conversation with the person who happens to be facing them in the circle. Each person speak for a brief 30 second period. When the organizer rings the chimes, the participants should take two steps left/right as instructed, so that they are now facing a different person. A new question is posted and the conversation begins again. Questions should be open-ended. Examples we have used in the past include: \"What first inspired me in the work is...\" \"A challenge I hope we can make progress on is...\" \"I belong at this hackweek because...\" \"I know I am in a positive learning environment when...\" \"One of my greatest strengths is...\" \"I know a team is functioning well when...\" \"Something I plan to give to this community is...\" In our experience, mad tea can be a noisy and highly energetic experience! Therefore providing clear instructions in advance, and having a good mechanism for signaling the rotation of the circles that can be heard by everyone, is especially important. The room also needs to be large enough to accommodate this particular structure. The rapid nature of this activity is designed to help people not over-think their responses, and to provide opportunities to speak with many different people. We feel it also helps people bring their awareness to their sense of belonging at the event, and the various ways they will navigate team dynamics and the challenges and opportunities of this learning environment. Drawing Together At hackweeks we all spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen, which can be a barrier to forming connections with other participants. This activity encourages people to interact in a more tactile way through hand drawings and sketches. Prior to the start of the event, we attach large strips of poster paper to the meeting room walls, and provide a variety of drawing and writing tools. Participants are then invited to form small groups and share ideas through their drawings. Astrohackweek has used this approach at the opening of their event. Particpants were invited to share a sketch of a data visualization representing some project they were currently working on. The intention behind this activity is to enable everyone to talk about the principles behind data visualization, even if they do not yet have the coding skills to implement such approaches. Our hope was that this helped foster conversations, while minimize anxiety for those participants at the early stages of their data science careers. Code of Conduct The code of conduct defines the rules and acceptable behaviors of participants during the event. All hackweeks post their code of conduct online ( example code of conduct ) and require participants to have read and agree to these terms before they register for the event. During the opening session we draw everyone's attention to the code of conduct again as a way to emphasize its importance. We recommend providing a handout with the code of conduct listed in writing, and talking through the various options participants have to report a code of conduct violation. Creating a Welcoming Learning Community Whereas the code of conduct provides a list of rules describing activities that must be avoided, this section focuses on ways the group can actively create a postive learning community. We begin this section with a brief introduction to the conecpt of learning communities , and then talk about the behaviors that have been shown to foster the development of such communities. Geohackweek used a simple structure to explore these behaviors. Participants were given a printout of the list of behaviors, and two instructors read through the list in sequence. Then participants were invited to turn to their neighbor and respond to these questions: \"Which of these behaviors resonates most with you?\" \"Which of these behaviors seems most challenging to you?\" The purpose of these activities was to give participants a chance to think more deeply about how their individual behaviors might impact the learning environment created during the coming week.","title":"Opening"},{"location":"Facilitation/opening/#opening-session","text":"The opening session provides organizers with a unique opportunity to set the overall tone of the event.

In a small group setting we explore skills needed to navigate technical and social challenges of building collaborative relationsihps with the aim of solving complex challenges. Research shows that this collaborative work increases the liklihood for innovation and creativity. Our wiki pages provide in-depth project guidelines and details on project management . Here we offer ideas on how to facilitate the project work so that participants can make the best use of their time. Forming Project Teams One of the biggest challenges in getting started on the projects is deciding which project to join. One approach to pitching and selecting projects that has worked well across multiple hackweeks is described below. Introduction to Projects and Hacking We begin with a short presentation describing the purpose of the projects. We remind participants that this is not an activity that will be graded, and that learning the process of collaborative software development is more important than generating any specific products or outcomes at the end of the week. We talk through the various roles and responsibilities of project team and data science leads, as well as of each individual in the group. We also describe the appropriate scope and depth of the projects, and talk about the collaboration tools to be used during the week. Generating Project Ideas Participants are now given some time to brainstorm on project ideas. We use either Impromptu Networking or 1-2-4-All , using an invitation such as, \"What data science challenge would you like to make progress on this week?\", or \"What problem could this group make progress on in the coming days?\". This session should last 20-30 minutes, giving people enough time to share ideas and gain additional clarity on an idea that might have been brewing for some time. Project Pitching After having a series of conversations we invite anyone who is ready to pitch an idea to come to the front of the room. First we have an instructor model the project pitch, which should be succinct, clear, and have a duration under one minute. At the end of the pitch we ask the person for a one word project name, which we then write on a large sticky note. One instructor also takes notes on a whiteboard so everyone can keep track of ideas being presented. Team Formation Each person who pitched an idea now takes their large sticky note and finds an area in the room to post the note, effectively setting up a temporary station where additional conversations can be conducted. Participants are then invited to walk to any station that interests them so that they can find out more information. This structure is a condensed version of Shift and Share and generally lasts 20-30 minutes. Often during this process, small teams will recognize areas of overlap with other teams and may decide to merge. Or, teams that have a lot of interest might split into a series of smaller teams. Generally the optimum team size is 4-7 people, but we have had smaller and larger teams that have worked as well. At this time, anyone who is still looking for a team can consult with an organizer and have additional discussions to aid their decision process. Team Introductions Once teams are formed they gather together at a chosen location to begin working together. We invite each team to begin by getting to know each other. Waterhackweek accomplished this by having \"Participant Bios\" prepared in advance that included a picture of the participant, their name and institution, and space to write about their background and coding experience. Two additional prompts on the page were: \"I want to contribute...\" and \"I want to focus my learning on...\". These forms were then shared within each team as a way to accelerate connections and minimize the liklihood that individuals get left out of group activities. Developing Positive Team Interactions The first few hours of a team's interactions can be critical in setting the tone for effective communication and collaboration. What often occurs is teams begin diving into the details, perhaps out of an excitement for the material they are working on. Or, there may be one team member who is particularly vocal and who may, intentionally or not, dominate the early phases of the project time. We recommend that the data science and project team leads should play an active role in facilitating the development of team interactions that include everyone on the team, and that help people rapidly find project activites that align with their skills. At geohackweek we invite participants to begin by documenting what they currently know aout the problem Project Check-ins It is a good idea to have regular check-ins with project teams in an effort to identify challenges before they become problematic, as well as to share any achievements and successes so far. The check-ins can be quite short, for example a 5-10 minute stand-up meeting where each team is asked to share one success and one challenge in their project so far. This is reported out to the full group in the hopes that other teams might be able to offer advice or resources in an area where a team might be stuck. At geohackweek we distributed post-it notes to each team on day 3 of the event and invited everyone to write down specific things that were working well, and other things that were areas for improvement. These were then displayed anonomyously on poster paper attached to a wall visible to everyone. As a group we then looked for patterns and common themes and discussed potential courses of action to address chellenges that needed to be solved. Final Presentations Final presentations are an opportunity for everyone to share what was accomplished within each team to the entire group. The duration of the presentations are fixed, but the format is flexible to allow groups to design a presentation that fits their particular work. We find that most groups distribute the speaking opportunities to most if not every member of the team, with one person providing an overall summary and integration of the work presented.","title":"Project Formation"},{"location":"Facilitation/projects/#hackweek-projects","text":"The purpose of hackweek projects is for participants to gain hands-on experience in working together on a well-defined problem.

It may be tempting and straightforward to select candidates that are known personally to the committee as good citizens of the community, but we strongly warn organizers that taking this approach might run counter several goals that a hack week might have. General Notes on the Selection Strategy In any approach, participant selection begins with a clear articulation of the goals of the workshop, and how participant selection might serve these goals. Possible goals are: * teaching data science methods to a wide range of researchers in your domain * encouraging collaborations between researchers of different fields * encouraging collaborations between researchers in different stages of their careers * improving access to modern methods and tools for researchers from underrepresented groups These are just examples: the goals of your workshop will necessarily depend on your community and its needs. In the ideal case, the formulated goals lead to a clear strategy for selecting participants. For example, a workshop that targets early-career researchers and is more teaching-oriented may wish to preferentially admit graduate students and postdocs, whereas a workshop aimed at collaboration across career stages may prefer to mix career stages more broadly. Similarly, organizers should articulate a strategy for assessing whether candidates have the appropriate skill level and are likely to participate in a way that creates a welcoming community for the group as a whole. We warn organizers to approach this part of the selection procedure very carefully: it is here that unconscious biases are most likely to derail a fair and equitable selection procedure. We recommend that organizers articulate a set of desirable traits and behaviours required in order to achieve a successful hack week, and then design questions that directly probe the participants' ideas about issues surrounding learning and collaboration. Ideally, multiple members of the committee rate each applicant according to a rubric. The resulting scores may then be combined in different ways and interrogated for uncoscious biases. Because no procedure, no matter how well designed, will be entirely bias-free and a hundred percent predictive, ranking participants and admitting according to ranking is unlikely to produce a balanced and unbiased cohort. It may be more advisable to set a reasonable cut-off score of some form (for example, all participants that are acceptable must at least have been given a score of 3 out of five by all reviewers), and then select within that set of acceptable candidates according to other criteria important to the workshop (for example, as mentioned in the example above, the mix of career stage). It may make sense to pre-select a subset of participants at this stage that all reviewers strongly agree on, but again we recommend against selecting all participants this way. A tool that we have successfully used in our hack weeks for the latter step--selection of the cohort out of a set of acceptable candidates, subject to multiple constraints--is called Entrofy . The accompanying notebook shows an example procedure for cohort selection, using a simulated data set. Organizers are encouraged to adapt this notebook to their own needs. Application Questions Here, we aim to present some guidance regarding the design of the application form. It is important that the details of the selection procedure are discussed and agreed upon before designing the application form. The key reason why this is necessary is simple: you cannot select on any attribute or skill you have not asked the candidates about! This has been an issue for all of us in our initial hack weeks: we realized during the selection that we needed information that we had not asked the candidates to provide. This is also the primary reason why organizers should think carefully about their goals while designing the selection procedure.

Organizers are encouraged to adapt this notebook to their own needs.","title":"General Notes on the Selection Strategy"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#application-questions","text":"Here, we aim to present some guidance regarding the design of the application form. It is important that the details of the selection procedure are discussed and agreed upon before designing the application form. The key reason why this is necessary is simple: you cannot select on any attribute or skill you have not asked the candidates about! This has been an issue for all of us in our initial hack weeks: we realized during the selection that we needed information that we had not asked the candidates to provide. This is also the primary reason why organizers should think carefully about their goals while designing the selection procedure.","title":"Application Questions"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#general-questions","text":"name e-mail address (don't forget this! you need to contact your candidates somehow!) institution","title":"General Questions"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#questions-probing-motivation-and","text":"","title":"Questions Probing Motivation and"},{"location":"ParticipantSelection/ParticipantSelection-intro/#demographic-questions","text":"","title":"Demographic Questions"},{"location":"Tutorials/Tutorials-intro/","text":"Template for Tutorials (ask Anthony for template)","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Tutorials/Tutorials-intro/#template-for-tutorials","text":"(ask Anthony for template)","title":"Template for Tutorials"},{"location":"Website/Website-intro/","text":"A template website for a hack week In this folder you'll find a template website for making your own hack week website!","title":"A template website for a hack week"},{"location":"Website/Website-intro/#a-template-website-for-a-hack-week","text":"In this folder you'll find a template website for making your own hack week website!","title":"A template website for a hack week"}]}
